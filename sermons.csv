Would you conclude that someone had assembled the robot and left it there? Or would you decide that this robot had assembled by random chance? It would clearly take a quantum leap of faith to conclude that the robot just happened by chance, even if the robot had many years to assemble.</p><p>Now let’s compare a robot to a human being. I think we can all agree that there is absolutely no comparison. Although a robot is remarkable and many have dreamt of having one to order around, human beings are far more complex and are undoubtedly the most amazing “machine” ever. How did humans get here? Did God create us? To help answer these questions, let’s briefly and simplistically examine some of the intricacies and complexities of the human body.</p><h3>Your Brain</h3><p>You have a brain that analyzes, recalls, calculates, communicates, comprehends, and operates your entire body. No computer can come close to that. Your brain even equips you with the ability to accept or rej ect the existence of God. Your brain can instantaneously send messages to your tongue, mouth, and lips, instructing them precisely how to contort so you can effortlessly verbalize a word that someone else can comprehend —</p><p>thanks to his or her own brain! Do you want to see the amazing versatility and capabilities of a simple part of your body? Please open and close your fist. How did that happen? Your brain sent a signal to your hand instructing it to behave as you desired.</p><p>Your brain did not have to physically touch your hand to make it move. Instead, it sent an electrical signal through your nerves (biological electrical cables) and spinal cord to the muscles in your hand and voilà, the clench of your fist, the snap of your fingers, or the creation of art. The options and features are only limited by the creativity of your brain. Your hand also collects sensory information, such as touch and temperature, which it sends to your spinal cord and back to your brain for processing. Your hand has more standard features than a brand new Mercedes!</p><p>Sir Isaac Newton, a brilliant discerning scientist, concluded “the thumb alone would convince me of God’s existence.” While you sleep, for tunately your brain does not shut down. Instead, it continues to work and keep you alive. It also allows you to dream. You can dream some rather bizarre scenarios that might include talking trees, flying pizza, mammoth scoops of ice cream, and horses in the shape of wagons. These remarkable “special effects” are produced by your incredible brain! After a full night of dreaming, you typically awake refreshed. This replenishing feature is incorporated right into your body. Do you know another machine that recharges itself…on its own? Your brain commands your legs to walk, run, or ride a bike with ease, and even enables your body to multi-task. Many of us can converse with someone about a complex topic while driving a car or putting away groceries. When your brain is in conscious-mode, it can remember details of birthdays and other special events and occurrences for 80 years or more! I can vividly remember events that happened when I was a young child and most likely you can too. Your brain also has memory that enables you to effortlessly recall a commercial jingle or hit song you have not heard for decades! The capabilities of your brain are something to behold!</p><h3>Your Eyes</h3><p>While you were relaxing peacefully in your mother’s womb, over one million nerve fibers from your brain each matched up flawlessly with the correct stations in your retina and your vision was established. Imagine the likelihood of that occurrence! The moment you were born, your eyes began “e-mailing” three dimensional digital images to your brain that were, most likely, perfectly in focus&nbsp;. Throughout your lifetime, your eyelids have instinctively blinked to provide moisture that is essential to the function of your eyeballs. Imagine the challenge it would be to sleep without eyelids. For optimal performance, the pupil of your eye gradually contracts when it is bright and sunny and dilates when it is dark.</p><p>Variations in these automatic setting options for your pupils are virtually infinite. Some eyes even change color in the sun. The standard features on your eyes are extraordinary. Your eye is a highly sophisticated and technologically advanced piece of equipment. Did your eyes just happen by chance or did they have a designer? Even Charles Darwin, the creator of the theory of evolution, acknowledged that it was “absurd in the highest degree” to conclude that the eye happened by chance: To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.</p><h3>Your Digestive System</h3><p>In simple, non-graphic terms, your digestive system includes four component parts: mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines. You could not survive without any of the four; they all had to appear on the scene simultaneously. Essentially a complete and highly sophisticated assembly line exists inside of you! The assembly line begins with your mouth where teeth tear and grind up food so it can travel down your throat.</p><p>You do not even have to think about swallowing. It has been virtually automatic since you were an infant. Just before swallowing you are afforded the opportunity to savor the flavor of the food courtesy of about 200 taste buds on your tongue.</p><p>After swallowing, your body inexplicably creates and secretes the precise chemicals needed, at the appropriate spots, to further break down the food. This assembly line performs all necessary tasks as the food travels on to its next destination. Nothing is out of order. Al l is perfectly fine tuned. Numerous parts work in perfect harmony with each other; among these are the tongue, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, sphincters, stomach, small intestine, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, and large intestine. At the end of the assembly line, nourishment is distributed throughout your body — to your muscles, skin, and other tissues. Most of what is not needed is eliminated. If this elimination phase in the digestive process did not happen, you would explode or be poisoned. Simply amazing, is it not, that all of these components are perfectly placed? It is difficult for me to believe that this highly sophisticated system randomly assembled.</p><h3>Your Heart and Circulatory System</h3><p>You are equipped with an amazing heart, with four distinct chambers, which pumps vitally needed oxygen-rich blood to each of the 75 trillion cells in your body. This is done 24/7 without any conscious effort on your part. Your body is capable of replenishing its blood and the blood itself is capable of distributing oxygen throughout your body. Your blood is also able to clot. Without this “special effect,” most of us would die after our first shave, if not sooner. To transport blood, your heart requires 75,000 miles of intricately woven blood vessels. You have three types of blood vessels (veins, arteries, and capillaries) which are anatomically distinct and perform different functions.</p><p>Arteries are elastic; they expand and contract as they pump the blood away from your heart. Veins return the blood back to your heart and contain strategically placed valves which prevent blood from pooling and flowing back to your legs due to gravity. Capillaries are amazing too, merely one cell in diameter and perform various functions depending upon where they are placed in the body. Imagine if all of these components did not materialize at the same time! I cannot imagine the blueprints or engineering expertise required for such an intricate system. Can you?</p><p>You can read the entire book online for free here on this website. <a href="https://www.ihaveafriendwhoisjewish.com/" target="_blank">Click here to read it now</a></p>	#08D316	12	article	\N	\N	\N	t

Heaven is the dwelling place of God (Deut. 26:15; Matt. 6:9).</p><p>2. Heaven is the dwelling place of God’s angels (Luke 2:15; Matt. 28:2; Heb. 12:22).</p><p>3. Heaven is the dwelling place of God’s believers from earth who have died and now live there in his presence (Rev. 4–5; Luke 16:22, 25; Heb. 12:23).</p><p>4. At death, the human spirit leaves the body (Ec. 12:2) and goes either to heaven or hell (Luke 16:22ff).</p><p>5. There is immediate conscious existence after death, both in heaven and hell (Luke 16:22ff.; Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 5:8; Rev. 6:9–11; Phil. 1:23). There is no “soul sleep” or period of unawareness preceding heaven. (“Fallen asleep” in 1 Thes. 4:13 is a euphemism for death, describing the spirit’s departure from the body, ending our conscious existence on earth.)</p><p>6. Heaven is an actual place, to and from which Messiah (John 1:32; 6:33; Acts 1:2), angels (Matt. 28:2; Rev. 10:1) and in rare circumstances people, even prior to their deaths, have traveled (2 Kings 2:11; 2 Cor. 12:2; Rev. 11:12).</p><p>7. Heaven is consistently referred to as “up” in location (Mark 6:41; Luke 9:51). We do not know whether it is a place “in the heavens” (the universe beyond the earth) or entirely outside the space/time continuum. We do know heaven is someplace, and presently that place isn’t earth.</p><p>8. Heaven is where Messiah came from (John 6:42), where he returned after his resurrection (Acts 1:11), where he now is and from which he will physically return to earth again (Acts 1:11; Rev. 19:1–16).</p><p>9. Heaven is described as a city (Heb. 11:16; 12:22; 13:14; Rev. 21:12). The normal understanding of a “city” is a place of many residences in near proximity, the inhabitants of which are subject to a common government. “City” may also connote varied and bustling activity.</p><p>10. Heaven contains for believers a permanent inheritance, an unperishing estate specifically reserved for us. (1 Pet. 1:4).</p><p>11. Heaven is the Believer’s country of citizenship (Heb. 11:16; Phil. 3:20). Messiah is our King. We are his ambassadors, representing his agenda on earth (2 Cor. 5:20). While on our brief stay here, we are aliens, strangers and pilgrims (Heb. 11:3). Ambassadors, aliens and pilgrims identify themselves and plan their lives with a focus on their home country. Should they become too engrossed in the alien country where they temporarily reside, they can easily compromise their allegiances to their true King and true country.</p><p>12. God’s people should long for heaven. This pleases our Lord, who has prepared a place there for us (Heb. 11:13–16; 2 Cor. 5:2). We should be ever-motivated by the anticipation of heaven (Phil. 3:14; 2 Tim. 4:8).</p><p>13. Heaven and all that it represents should be a central object of our attention in this life. Our hearts or minds are to be continuously set on these “things above” where Messiah is in heaven, not on “earthly things” (Col. 3:1–4).</p><p>Note: The popular notion of Believers being “so heavenly minded they’re of no earthly good” is a myth. On the contrary, most of us are so earthly minded we are of no heavenly or earthly good. C. S. Lewis said, “It is since Believers have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this one.” God commands us to be heavenly minded, and doing so will give us the perspective and motivation to live on earth as he has commanded us (Heb. 11:26–27).</p><p>14. There is a sense in which believers are currently in heaven with Messiah (Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:3). Our intimate link with Messiah in his redemptive work somehow makes us inseparable from him. As we walk with him and commune with him in this world, this reality makes it sometimes possible to experience a faint foretaste of heaven’s delights and wonders.</p><p>15. Heaven will provide us delivery from the present conditions of material decay and corruption (Matt. 6:20).</p><p>16. Heaven will provide us delivery from the current sinful human condition (Rom. 7:24).</p><p>17. The redeemed in heaven are described as “shining” and wearing “white robes,” indicating their moral purity and righteousness (Dan. 12:3; Matt. 13:43; Rev. 3:4; 6:11).</p><p>18. Heaven is a place of great joy and pleasures for the redeemed (Psalm 16:11)</p><p>19. The names of Messiah’s redeemed are written in heaven (Luke 10:20; Heb. 12:23; Rev. 20:15).</p><p>20. When in his presence, Messiah will give new names to the righteous, known only between him and them (Rev. 2:17). This implies some level of privacy.</p><p>21. The wicked, those whose sins remain uncleansed by the blood of Messiah, will be excluded from heaven (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 22:15).</p><p>22. Heaven’s central draw is our anticipation of being with Messiah (Phil. 1:23).</p><p>23. Another draw of heaven is our anticipation of continued and unhindered life, and ultimate reunion with Believer loved ones who’ve gone before us and will come after us (1 Thes. 4:14–18).</p><p>24. Heaven has not remained the same since its creation, but has undergone several phases, and will experience future change as well. At least five distinct phases of heaven seem identifiable. There was the pre-sin heaven, before Satan fell (Is. 14:12–15), apparently taking a third of the angels with him (Rev. 12:4). There was the Old Testament heaven of Paradise or “Abraham’s bosom” ( Luke 16:22), which was then one of two compartments of Hades, “the place of the dead,” the other compartment being Hell. Then came the current post-resurrection-of-Messiah heaven, where Paradise seems to have been relocated from Hades, and where believers now come directly into his presence at death (Eph. 4:8–10; 2 Cor. 5:8). The millennial kingdom, where Messiah rules over the earth with his redeemed seems to be a phase of Heaven (Rev. 20:14). Then there is the Heaven still to come after the final judgment, the New Jerusalem in the new heavens and new earth (Rev. 21–22).</p><p>Similarly, what we now refer to as Hell (the only compartment of Hades left since the relocation of Paradise to Heaven) will, after the Great White Throne judgment, itself be relocated in the eternal lake of fire, the ultimate hell (Rev. 20:14–15).</p><p>Note: Heaven is not yet as it one day will be. There is still sin and suffering in the universe which will not be relieved until after the present heaven and earth pass away, and the heavenly city is established (Rev. 21:4). There are said to presently still be “spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Eph. 6:12). This may explain the apparent incongruity of the already-fallen Satan’s coming before the presence of God (Job 1:6) and the future “war in heaven” (Rev. 12:7) in which Satan is cast down in some further or final sense. He is not finally defeated until a thousand years after he is bound in the pit and then after one last rage of evil, thrown forever into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:2,7,10).</p><p>The resurrection of believers has not yet occurred, and will not until just prior to the new heavens and earth (Rev. 20:15–20). Hence, though the present heaven we enter at death is a wonderful place, it is not yet complete, not in its most glorious form.</p><p>25. Heaven contains an actual sanctuary which served as the pattern for the earthly tabernacle (Heb. 8:5; 9:11,23–24). Yeshua currently “serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the LORD, not man” (Heb. 8:2). In heaven there is a temple that contains the prototype ark of the covenant (Rev. 11:19, 15:5). (This violates the popular notion of a “spiritual” heaven with no physical form, suggesting heaven is a more tangible reality than we often imagine.)</p><p>26. Messiah promised his followers they would live with him in heaven (John 12:26; 13:36; 14:2–3).</p><p>27. Yeshua described heaven as having many rooms or dwellings, and promised that he himself would go there and prepare a place there for us (John 14:2–3).</p><p>28. When we are in heaven, it may be possible for us to welcome others into our dwelling places. After speaking of the shrewd servant’s desire to use earthly resources so that “people will welcome me into their houses,” Yeshua tells his followers to use “worldly wealth” (earthly resources) to “gain friends” (by making a difference in their lives on earth), “so that when it is gone [when life on earth is over] you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings” (Luke 16:9).</p><p>Note: Our “friends” in heaven appear to be to those whose lives we’ve touched in a significant way on earth. They will apparently have their own “eternal dwellings.” This fits the Bible’s portrayal of heaven as a city. In a nonparabolic context, Messiah promised to prepare for us dwelling places in heaven (John 14:2–3). Luke 16:9, then, may literally mean these eternal dwelling places of friends could be places to fellowship and/or reside in as we move about the heavenly kingdom.</p><p>29. Some believers will receive a “rich welcome” when they enter heaven (2 Peter 1:11). It seems possible, and in keeping with Luke 16:1–9, those who on earth have impacted and/or been impacted by the arriving believer (perhaps including family members), and who have gone to heaven before him, may participate in the welcoming committee at his “rich welcome” into heaven.</p><p>30. Messiah’s resurrection body appears to be the prototype for our own heavenly bodies (1 Cor. 15:20, 48–49; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2). After his resurrection, Yeshua emphasized he was not a “ghost,” a disembodied spirit, but had a physical body (Luke 24:37–39.)</p><p>31. In our resurrected state we will have real “spiritual” bodies with physical substance (1 Cor. 15:42–44). We will be capable of talking, walking, touching and being touched (Luke 24; John 20–21). Messiah’s resurrection body had an ability to appear suddenly, apparently coming through a locked door to the apostles (John 20:19), and “disappearing” from the sight of the two at Emmaus (Luke 24:31). If our resurrection bodies have the same properties as his, this suggests an ability to transcend the present laws of physics and/or to move and travel in some way we are now incapable of.</p><p>32. Messiah ate food in his resurrection body, and he and we will eat and drink in heaven (Luke 14:15; 22:18). Yet there will be no hunger or thirst in heaven (Rev. 7:16). It would seem the resurrection body does not need what is now essential–food, drink, oxygen, covering, etc.–but that it is nonetheless fully capable of enjoying some or all of these things (and no doubt many more).</p><p>33. Between our entrance to heaven and our resurrection, we may have temporary pre-resurrection bodies (e.g. Luke 16:19ff.; Rev. 6:11). This fits the notion that unlike God and the angels, who are in essence spirits though capable of inhabiting bodies (John 4:24; Heb. 1:14), man is in essence both spiritual and physical (Gen. 2:7). Hence, between our earthly life and our resurrection, a temporary body would allow us to retain the qualities of full humanity.</p><p>Note: Some Believers seem strangely repulsed at the biblical teachings of the tangible nature of our heavenly bodies and the heavenly state. But this teaching should not surprise us, since humans have both a spiritual and a physical dimension. We do not become inhuman in heaven, we become everything humans are capable of being by virtue of both creation and redemption. Matthew 22:30, for instance, does not teach we will be genderless (gender is a God-created aspect of humanity) or otherwise non-human, but simply that there will be no marriage in heaven.</p><p>Much misunderstanding stems from the Greek/Platonic belief that the body is evil and the spirit’s highest destiny is to be free from the body. This is in stark contrast to the biblical belief that God is the Creator of both body and spirit, both of which were marred by sin, but both of which are redeemed by Messiah. True, I need to be delivered from my earthly body, which is subject to sin and decay (Rom. 7:24). But the promise of the heavenly state is not the absence of body, but the attainment of a new and sinless body and spirit. In 1 Cor. 15, Paul regards the new body–not simply the new spirit–as essential to our redemption. If the body is not redeemed, then man is not redeemed, since man is by nature body as well as spirit. A spirit without a body, like a body without a spirit, is not the highest human destiny, but would be a state of incompleteness, an aberration from the full meaning of humanness.</p><p>34. At death the believer is ushered into heaven by angels (Luke 16:22). We may be accompanied in death’s relocation by ministering angel(s) who have served us while we were on earth (Heb. 1:14). Some angels are assigned to children, and they have special continuous access to God (Matt. 18:10). This suggests that ministering or guardian angels could be assigned to people even prior to their conversion to Messiah, though this is uncertain.</p><p>Note: Angels are individual beings who have their own names, and are capable of reasoning, speech and interaction (Dan. 8:16–26; Luke 1:26–38; Dan. 10:13, 31; Rev. 12:1). Angels active on earth are normally invisible to human eyes (2 Kings 6:17). They are sent out by God in response to prayer, and wage war on behalf of God and men (Dan. 9:21, 23; 10:12–13; Rev. 12:7). Angels can take on physical form and appear as humans (Gen. 18–19). We can respond to or interact with angels, unaware of their identity (Heb. 13:2).</p><p>35. In heaven, we will worship God along with the angels and redeemed people from every race and background (Rev. 4:9–11; 5:11–13; 7:9–12).</p><p>36. In heaven, we will sing praise songs along with all the rest of God’s creation (Rev. 5:13).</p><p>37. Communication, dialogue, corporate worship and other relationship-building interactions all take place heaven (Rev. 1–22). Apparently believers and angels and God will all interact together, building and deepening their relationships.</p><p>38. In heaven, we will exercise not only intellect but emotions (Rev. 6:10; 7:10). Angels too seem capable of responding with emotion (Rev. 7:11–12; Rev. 18). Heaven is described as a place where there is great rejoicing (an emotional response) over what God is accomplishing on earth (Luke 15:7,10).</p><p>Note: Some suggest there will be no emotions in heaven. But emotions are part of God-created humanity, not some sinful baggage we are to be cleansed of. We should not expect the absence of emotion there, but pure and accurately informed emotions, emotions guided by reality, not easily misled and subjective feelings. The tears that will be wiped away are the tears of suffering over sin and death (Rev. 21:4). Since we are capable of now shedding tears stemming from joy, there is no reason to believe there could be no tears of joy in heaven. (For instance, at meeting Messiah or at reunion with loved ones.)</p><p>And since the loving acts of God for his people, including his death on the cross, naturally prompt the spiritually sensitive to tears (and we will be more, not less, spiritually sensitive in heaven), it seems possible that there could be tears of sobriety and gratitude over the redemptive price Yeshua paid for us. This could be true throughout eternity, but certainly could apply prior to the New Heaven and New Earth where the “no more tears” promise first appears.</p><p>39. Heaven is a place from which God is said to exercise his wrath against godlessness on earth (Rom. 1:18), and even to send down his judgment of fire (Rev. 13:13; 20:9). In heaven, believers gain an increased sense of holiness and long for God’s wrath and vengeance to be poured out against injustice (Rev. 6:9–11). Angels in heaven too long for God’s judgment to be exercised against the ungodly (Rev. 16:4–7).</p><p>40. In heaven, we will have eternal rewards, permanent possessions and positions which vary from believer to believer (Matt. 6:19–25; 25:20–21; Luke 19:17–19; 1 Cor. 3:12–15; 2 Cor. 5:9,10). Rewards will be granted in light of our faithfulness and motives (1 Cor. 4:2,5). In dispensing rewards, Messiah will not overlook the smallest act of kindness done in his name (Mark 9:41).</p><p>Note: Heavenly rewards are promised to those who endure difficult circumstances out of their trust in God (Heb. 10:34–36), and to those who persevere under persecution for their faith (Luke 6:22, 23). A life of godliness (2 Peter 3:11–14) and compassionate obedience (Matthew 25:20, 21) will be richly rewarded by our Lord. When we extend hospitality and give a meal to those too poor or incapacitated to pay us back Messiah promises us “although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous” (Luke 14:14).</p><p>Salvation and rewards are completely different. Salvation is God’s work from man given as a free gift, to which man can contribute absolutely nothing (Eph. 2:8–9; Titus 3:5). Rewards, however, are man’s work for God. Salvation is dependent on God’s faithfulness and mercy, while rewards are conditional, contingent as well on man’s faithfulness (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 2:26–28; 3:21).</p><p>41. At least five different crowns are given as heavenly rewards: the crown of life (James 1:12; Rev. 2:10), the incorruptible crown (1 Cor. 9:24, 25), crown of rejoicing (1 Thes. 2:19; Phil. 4:1), crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:1–4), and crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:6–8).</p><p>The crowns may relate to positions of ruling in heaven (Luke 19:17; Rev. 2:26–28), but in any case they are lasting reminders of our work on earth, and Messiah’s faithfulness in enabling us to do that work. Ultimately these crowns put at Messiah’s feet, to recognize him (Rev. 4:10). Our rewards are given not merely for our recognition, but for God’s eternal glory. However, Scripture sees no contradiction whatsoever between God’s eternal glory and our eternal good.</p><p>Note: While heaven will be wonderful for all its inhabitants, not every believer’s position and experience in heaven will be the same. As hell has different punishments (Matt&nbsp;.11:20–24; Luke 20:45–47), so heaven has different rewards. Perhaps it will be a matter of differing capacity. Two jars can both be full, but the one with greater capacity contains more. Likewise, all of us will be full of joy in heaven, but some may have more joy because their capacity for joy will be larger, having been stretched through their trust in and obedience to God in this life.</p><p>42. Heaven should be looked to by the believer as the time when all righteous acts–many of which will have been disregarded and some punished on earth–will be finally rewarded. There is a “proper time” for the harvest, a time that normally follows our life on earth–“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” (Galatians 6:9).</p><p>The Believer’s works done for God’s glory will have eternal significance–of those who die in Messiah, God says “their deeds will follow them” (Rev. 14:13). Our rewards in heaven will link us eternally to our service for Messiah while on earth. There is a radical change in our location, but no essential discontinuity between our lives here and there.</p><p>Note: As Scripture gives no opportunity for the unbeliever to go back to earth and live his life again and this time to put faith in Messiah, so there is no opportunity for the believer to go back and relieve his life, this time for Messiah. There is no indication that rewards missed by virtue of lack of service on earth (1 Cor. 3: 13–15) will be later achieved in some other way. In heaven, how we have lived on earth will have eternal effects.</p><p>43. In heaven, we will serve God (Rev. 7:15). Service implies responsibilities, duties, effort, and creativity to do work well. (Work with lasting accomplishment, unhindered by decay and fatigue, and enhanced by unlimited resources.)</p><p>44. In heaven, we will be given rest from our labors on earth (Rev. 14:13). The rest granted us when by Messiah on earth (Matt. 11:28–29), paradoxically, is a rest we now must “make every effort to enter” (Heb. 4:11). Heaven’s labor will be refreshing, productive and unthwarted, without futility and frustration. Perhaps it will be like the Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:15), before sin brought the curse on the ground, with its thorns (Gen. 3:17–19).</p><p>45. In accord with our service for Messiah while on earth, we will reign with Him in heaven (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 3:21; 22:5). This implies specific delegated responsibilities for those under our leadership (Luke 19:17–19). We judge or rule over the world and we judge and rule over angels (1 Cor. 6:2–3).</p><p>46. At the center of the future heaven will be the city of the New Jerusalem. The exact dimensions of the heavenly city are measured by an angel and reported as a 12,000 stadia (1500 mile) cube (Rev. 22:15–17). This base of over two million square miles would stretch from the west coast to the Mississippi river, and from the borders of Canada to Mexico, covering two thirds the entire land mass of the United States. More astounding is its 1500 mile height. By present standards, that would be 780,000 stories. It is apparently within this vast city that we will have personal dwelling places, which Yeshua has prepared for us (John 14:2; Luke 16:9; Rev. 21:2).</p><p>Note: While the dimensions and proportions may have symbolic importance (e.g. the Holy of Holies, God’s dwelling place, was a cube), this does not mean the dimensions are not literal. In fact, Rev. 22 goes to great lengths to express these exact dimensions and to emphasize they are in “man’s measurement”–if the city really were these dimensions (and there is no reason it couldn’t be), what more could we expect God to say to convince us of this?</p><p>47. Heaven’s New Jerusalem is filled with magnificent beauty, including streets of gold and buildings of pearls, emeralds and precious stones (Rev. 21:19–21).</p><p>48. Heaven has light, water, trees and fruit (Rev. 22:1–2).</p><p>49. The heavenly city’s gates are always open, and people will travel in and out, some bringing wonderful things into the city (Rev. 21:24–25; 22:14). Travel outside the city suggests the city is not the whole of heaven, but merely its center.</p><p>50. Heaven contains some animals (including wolves, lambs, and lions), at least in its millennial phase (Isaiah 65:25). Even before the millennium, there are horses in heaven (Rev. 6:2–8; 19:11), enough for the armies of heaven to ride (Rev. 19:11; 2 Kings 6:17).</p><p>51. In heaven, we’ll eat and drink at a table with Messiah and the redeemed believers from earth, communicating and fellowshipping and rejoicing with them (Matt. 8:11; Luke 22:29, 30; Rev. 19:9).</p><p>By Randy Alcorn, Eternal Perspective Ministries, 39085 Pioneer Blvd., Suite 206, Sandy, OR 97055, 503–668–5200, <a href="http://www.epm.org," target="_blank">www.epm.org,</a> <a href="http://www.randyalcorn.blogspot.com" target="_blank">www.randyalcorn.blogspot.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Read my short book for free. <a href="https://www.ihaveafriendwhoisjewish.com/" target="_blank">Click Here to read it now.</a></p>	#08D316	22	article	\N	\N	\N	t

The late Dr. Louis Goldberg once told of the time that he went into the store of a Jewish proprietor:</p><p>He looked so depressed and dejected that I asked him what was wrong. He replied, “I have just attended the funeral of my favorite aunt.” Softly I inquired, “And where is she now? Will you see her again?” “You know what we believe about death,” he replied, “When a person dies, the body is placed in the ground, and this is all there is to it… All that remains is the memory of the departed in the hearts of the living.”</p><p>That man was not alone in his belief that death was the final curtain. Yet there are noted Jewish scholars and rabbis in all the main branches who do not dismiss belief that after death there is an afterlife.</p><p>Orthodox Rabbi, Shraga Simmons, writes:i</p><ul><li>The afterlife is a fundamental of Jewish belief! The creation of man testifies to the eternal life of the soul. Heaven is where the soul experiences the greatest possible pleasure — the feeling of closeness to God. Of course not all souls experience that to the same degree. It’s like going to a symphony concert. Some tickets are front-row center; others are back in the bleachers.</li></ul><p>Reform Judaism has shifted in recent years to a stronger affirmation of an afterlife after death as well. The Central Conference of American Rabbis state in their platform:</p><ul><li>Several generations of Reform Jews took as a matter of Reform Jewish faith the denial of any life after death beyond the naturalist concepts of living on in memory or in deeds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The culture in which we live no longer presumes that immortality is unscientific, irrational or unbelievable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Regardless of what you may have heard, the promise of eternal life of the spirit is part and parcel of Reform Judaism.iii</li></ul><p>Dr. Neil Gillman, a professor of philosophy at New York’s Jewish Theological Seminary, a bastion of Conservative Jewish thought, gave the following perspective of life after death in an interview with Barbara Walters:</p><ul><li>“For the past 2,000 years, most Jews believed that at death the body and the soul separate, the body is interred and disintegrates in the Earth, the soul goes off to be with God,” he tells Walters. But that’s not the end of the story. “At the end of days, God will resurrect bodies, will reunite body and soul, and the individual will come before God to account for his or her life,” Gillman said.iv</li></ul><p>Jewish people who believe in a resurrection of the soul and/or the body after death, have various views on the final destination of the individual, some of which are based on passages from the Bible. The Hebrew Scriptures speak of a place called “Sheol” where each person resides between death and resurrection. The righteous are on one side of Sheol, the unrighteous on the other, with a wide, impassable chasm between the two.</p><p>The Jewish Scriptures also speak of the Day of Judgment. The Hebrew prophet Daniel spoke of a judgment in the world to come: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2). What is the basis for that fate?</p><p>Traditional Jewish teaching specifies three classes into which people are sorted on this day: the perfectly righteous, the completely wicked, and the average people. The righteous are sealed for eternal life and dwell forever in a place of extreme beauty called Gan Eden, the Garden of Eden, distinct from the place where Adam and Eve were formed. The wicked are destined for Gehinnom, a place of punishment said to be located beneath the earth. Those sent there are tormented by a fire of intense heat, which, according to some, never ceases. For the third class, the average people, many scholars teach that there is some type of purgatory experience, where the person cries out in repentance and is then released to the Garden of Eden.v</p><p>The variety of opinions and the volume of literature concerning life after death attest to one thing: the Hebrew Scriptures are as true today as when they first declared that God has “set eternity in their heart” (Ecclesiastes 3:11). Whether or not we admit it, we all long for something beyond this life, and we sense that God (even if we question his existence) has made us with the possibility of living with him forever.</p><p>But if heaven does exist, how do we obtain it? After death, who makes it to heaven? And who does not? How can we be sure we will go there? Most of us would probably consider ourselves to be in that average class of people, not extremely righteous and not terribly wicked. We probably regard ourselves as basically good. And if there is a heaven, won’t all good people go there?</p><p>The Barna Research Group found that 54% of Americans believe that if a person is generally good, or does enough good things for others during her life, he or she will earn a place in heaven. This however begs the question of what is good? Most of us would list things like being kind to others, giving to charity, and earning an honest living. We all fall short sometimes, but surely, we reason, God will overlook those things, won’t he?</p><p>To answer this question, it helps to examine God’s character, His nature. The prophet Isaiah said, “For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy” (Isaiah 57:15). The Hebrew word translated as Holy is kadosh, which means “set apart” or “distinct.” That which is kadosh is differentiated from that which is common; the Creator is distinct from the creation.</p><p>According to Jewish thought, heaven is where people dwell in God’s presence. If this is the case, then we can only approach this set apart God on his terms. In so doing, we begin to sense that God’s definition of “good” may be a bit different than ours.</p><p>When Isaiah had his vision of God on his throne in the Temple, his response was “Woe is me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty” (Isaiah 6:5). Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, whenever God revealed himself to an individual, that person was overwhelmed with the awesomeness of God’s presence, and usually expected death to occur from the encounter. It is almost as if God has a problem. He wants to have a relationship with His creation, but if we attempt to draw too near to him, we will be destroyed!</p><p>The Scriptures teach that man and woman, made in the image of God, were tarnished by the fall in the Garden of Eden. Before they listened to the serpent, Adam and Eve had free and open communication with God. After giving into temptation, they hid from God due to their shame and the sense that they deserved His punishment. Could it possibly be this same sense of guilt that makes us afraid of death, since we sense that judgment awaits us as well?</p><p>The perfectly righteous God has to judge unrighteousness. Bible scholar, J. I. Packer explains:</p><ul><li>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. part of God’s moral perfection is his perfection in judgment. Would a God who did not care about the difference between right and wrong be a good and admirable Being? Moral indifference would be an imperfection in God, not a perfection.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The final proof that God is a perfect moral Being, not indifferent to questions of right and wrong, is the fact that he has committed himself to judge the world.vii</li></ul><p>What is the proper judgment for each of us whose very nature, according to the Scriptures, falls cataclysmically short of the perfect holiness of God? The prophet Ezekiel states in the Scriptures, “The person who sins will die.”viii Ezekiel is speaking of spiritual death, eternal separation from God. But don’t all of us sin, don’t all of us do wrong? If so, none of us, the Scriptures seem to indicate, will go to heaven.</p><p>Are we really that bad? Certainly not in our own eyes. But we need to remember that we see ourselves through a distorted lens. Only God sees us for what we really are, compared to Himself, the true standard of goodness. If heaven were a gathering place for people, we might safely compare ourselves to our neighbors and conclude we are good enough for them. But if heaven is the presence of our absolutely holy God, none of us is good enough.</p><p>But although the Bible observes that God would be justified in rejecting us forever, it also reveals that He has made a way for us to be with him now, after death, and throughout eternity. God is holy and just, but He is equally merciful: “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin.”ix</p><p>The key to a right relationship with God is forgiveness of our sins. If our sins are forgiven, God can see us as just and connect with us again. However, God cannot merely overlook sin. The sin must be acknowledged and the penalty must be paid. The sacrificial system was instituted with just that purpose.</p><p>On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, the high priest took the blood of the animals put to death on the altar and sprinkled it in the Holy Place: “He shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the impurities of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions, in regard to all their sins.” x God had already told the Israelites that blood was required for the forgiveness of sins: ‘For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.”xi</p><p>God has always made a way through sacrifice for us to return to right standing with Him both for now and in the life hereafter. However, if God had intended the Jewish sacrificial system to continue, He would not have allowed the Romans in 70 A.D. to destroy the Temple, where He had commanded his people to offer those sacrifices. Nor would He have allowed us to remain without the Temple to this very day. God had offered a new way for all people, Jew and Gentile, to enter into the promise of redemption and eternal life.xii</p><p>In the New Testament, we read of how God revealed that new means of handling sin: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.” xiii</p><p>“I am the way, and the truth, and the life,” Yeshua declared, “No one comes to the Father, but through Me” (John 14:6). This is a bold claim, but it makes sense, if Yeshua dealt with the sin that separates us from God. There are plenty of people who resent that claim. Plenty of relatively good people who are insulted by the idea that without Yeshua, God will bar them from heaven.</p><p><strong>Consider this statement:</strong></p><p>In the end God will judge fairly. The very nature of God prevents Him from being unfair. Genesis 18:25 asks, “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” xiv</p><p>People are not separated from God because they do not put their trust in Yeshua. They are separated from God by their sin. If you step off a cliff, you will fall, probably to your death. This is the law of gravity. If you die without the penalty paid for your sins, you will pay the penalty — eternal separation from God, in a place the Bible calls hell. This is as certain a law in the spiritual realm as is the law of gravity in the physical realm.</p><p>Some might ask, “Doesn’t sincerity count for anything?” Sincerity counts for a lot as a character trait, but it does not solve the problem of sin. If someone is drowning in the ocean, they can sincerely wish to be saved, but without a rope or a lifeboat their sincerity will go to their death with them. Or consider this illustration provided by Jeff Cummings:</p><p>A man is sitting in the airport. His destination is Chicago. Because of a computer error he and several other passengers are misinformed regarding the departure gate. He is unaware of this and sincerely believes the plane he is about to board is headed to Chicago. Unfortunately it is headed to San Francisco.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Just because a person is sincere in their beliefs, doesn’t mean they’re going where they think they are. We can be sincerely wrong. Sincerity doesn’t relieve us from the consequences of our misinformation.xv</p><p>The Hebrew word for sin means “to miss the mark.” With God, a miss is as good as a mile, because He can have nothing to do with sin. “But surely, for something as important as death and one’s eternal destiny,” one might reason, “there have to be alternate paths?”</p><p>John Ankerberg notes:</p><p>Did Buddha die for our sins? Did Mohammed die for our sins? Did Lao Tze, the founder of Taoism? Did Moses? Did Zoroaster, the founder of Parsism? Or Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism? None of these men ever claimed to do this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Only Yeshua solved the sin problem and conquered death, so logically, only Yeshua is the way of salvation and the way to God and eternal life. xvi</p><p>Aspirin may be helpful for some heart problems, but it won’t destroy a deadly tumor. The radical problem of sin requires a radical cure. Yeshua claimed to be that cure. Are you willing to use the prescription with His name on it?</p><p><br></p><h4>Resources</h4><p>i.

He paid for our sins in full through the sacrifice of His Son</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21). Anyone who rejects or ignores such a great sacrifice will spend eternity paying for that.</p><p><strong>Sin has to be judged (Rom. 6:23), and it was judged, in the flesh of Jesus (1 Pet. 2:24). But those who don’t make Jesus their Lord will have hell to pay for the greatest sin of all — rejecting Jesus’ sacrifice (John 16:8–9).</strong></p><p><strong>The sacrifice that Jesus made was infinitely greater than we have ever imagined.</strong> Not only does the Bible teach that He was not recognizable as a human being (Is. 52:14) while hanging on the cross, but it also teaches that He actually became sin (2 Cor. 5:21).</p><p>Just before He died, Jesus said, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46). God forsook Jesus. He could not look upon the sin that Jesus had become. And if He forsook His only Son, what chance would any of us have? <strong>That is why, for those who foolishly ignore this great sacrifice, there is a real hell.</strong></p><p>In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word she’owl was translated “hell” thirty-one times and “grave” thirty-one times. Nearly every time it’s translated “grave,” it’s talking about where the godly go after death, and when it’s translated “hell,” it’s talking about the destination of the ungodly.</p><p>Before Jesus’ resurrection, everyone went into the center of the earth when they died. It was separated into two compartments. One was called “Abraham’s bosom,” or “paradise,” while the other was called “hell,” a place of torment (Luke 16:23–28).</p><p>In the story about Lazarus and the rich man, the rich man spoke to Abraham from hell, the place of torment. Luke 16:22–26 says,</p><p>“And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou are tormented. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed.”</p><p>There is so much that we can learn from this passage. For one, it makes it clear that in she’owl, or hell, those who were in torment could see those across the gulf. They could hear, thirst, feel pain and sorrow, and even communicate with those in paradise. But the one thing that the people in hell will never be able to do is die.</p><p>After the Resurrection, things concerning hell changed. Jesus went to hell, took the keys of hell and death (Rev. 1:18), and set the captives free — those who were in Abraham’s bosom.</p><p><strong>Ephesians 4: 9–10 says,</strong></p><p>“Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.”</p><p><strong>After defeating the devil and setting the captives free, Jesus took those in Abraham’s bosom to heaven with Him, where all believers go now.</strong> But we will not live in heaven forever. We only live in heaven until the end of the age. Then God is going to make a new heaven and a new earth, and all the believers will live there with Jesus in the new Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1–4).</p><p>After that, hell will no longer be in the center of the earth, but it will be cast into a place that the Bible calls the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14), a place that was prepared for Satan and his angels (Matt. 25:41).</p><p>In Matthew 25, we read the story of the nations coming to the Lord on His throne where He divides the sheep from the goats.</p><p>In Matthew 25:34, He said to the righteous,</p><p>“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”</p><p>But to the unrighteous, He said,</p><p>“Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels” (Matt. 25:41).</p><p>Although it was never intended for man, hell is an awful place where those who reject so great a sacrifice will join the devil and his angels for eternity (Rev. 20:10).</p><p><strong>The Scripture, in Luke, also shows that the people God honors are not necessarily the same people the world honors (Luke 16:15).</strong> This rich man had a beautiful home, fancy clothes, and the best of everything. He had it all, but he never showed the beggar any mercy. When he died, I guarantee you he had a fancy funeral. Thousands of people may have gathered, all talking about how great his accomplishments were.</p><p>Yet the Bible says only that he was buried, left to rot in the grave. On the other hand, the beggar who was most despised on earth was carried away by angels. Which of the two would you rather have been? <strong>When you see this from an eternal perspective, it makes the suffering of this earth pale in comparison to what God has prepared for us (Rom. 8:18).</strong></p><p><strong>We can also see from Scripture that there are no second chances.</strong> There is no purgatory, as the Catholic Church teaches. There is no ultimate reconciliation. On earth, the rich man rejected God and went directly to hell. <strong>When the rich man pleaded for mercy, Abraham could do nothing. There will be no mercy, no hope, and no goodness of any kind in hell, ever.</strong></p><p>There isn’t a single person on this earth who deserves anything good from God. And there is absolutely nothing people can do to gain His favor. If that offends you, then you have just experienced the offense of the cross (Gal. 5:11). In comparison to God’s standards, man’s righteousness is no better than filthy rags (Is. 64:6). But God loves man so much that He sent Jesus, a Lamb without spot, to be a sacrifice for sin.</p><p><strong>If Jesus died for past, present, and future sins — which He did — then what determines whether we spend eternity with Him or in hell?</strong> The Bible makes it clear that the Holy Spirit convicts us of one sin, and it’s the only sin that will cause people to go to hell. That is the sin of rejecting the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</p><p>“And when he [the Holy Spirit] is come, he will reprove the world of sin [singular], and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of sin, because they believe not on me” (John 16:8–9, brackets mine).</p><p>To say the least, avoiding hell is big. However, <strong>what Jesus accomplished on the cross is far more than the avoidance of hell.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Read my short book for free. <a href="http://prophecyrevealed.com/https://www.ihaveafriendwhoisjewish.com/.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here to read it now.</a></p>	#031AF7	26	article	\N	\N	\N	t

No, I personally have not. Honestly, there have not been enough hours in the day for me to involve myself reading or composing email … given all the prayers needed each hour, and the massive number of insight and prayer requests, via the phone, that I’ve been receiving in regard to this COVID-19 crisis. Many are seeking understanding of how this happened, how to handle it, and where this is going. Everyone seems to be asking, “Is this the beginning of the new world order that will usher in the anti-Messiah sooner than we imagined?” “What do we do about vaccines?” “How do we pray.” It certainly appears that the global elite are making a definitive move on every front.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may address some of those thoughts more deeply in a future writing. Meanwhile, I will put some links at the end of this writing, so that you can explore some things for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I have found it very difficult to organize publications, and to write about the situations in Israel, because they are perpetually changing. I can write about something one moment, and find out that things have changed less than two hours later. It’s probably best for me to just sit with the Lord most of my time, and report what I am hearing from Him. He always links His words to the events taking place in the present day.</strong></p><p><strong>For a while, I was feeling a bit stressed about not getting Insight for Intercessors sent out every 7 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I realized what the Lord has been doing with me during the bulk of my hours at this time … even into the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, I get around 250 WhatsApp, and other phone communications each day. I am connecting with people in 6 continents almost daily. Those phone calls and messages involve sharing information and developments on the ground, or revelations, which are continually being clarified in the Spirit. It involves praying for people, encouraging them, and counseling them in their distress. Sometimes, it’s even a time for sharing humor. Then, there are the prayer conference calls across the nation that I’ve been leading or participating in. Many hours are spent joining with fellow believers over the phone lines and through computer visits, during this time when we all are in isolation/quarantine/sheltering in place. Much Kingdom work is being done through the invisible waves of the internet Wi-Fi and phone system. The conversations and prayers shared have been rich and very deep. It’s such a joy to finally be connecting on an hourly basis with true believers, as we join arms, hearts, faith, and intercession during this COVID-19 attack. So, I apologize for a lack of my guidance in regard to intercession on behalf of Israel. At the same time, that temporary change, of minimizing my detailed reports, may not be reversed until the COVID-19 crisis is shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say: The elite have made a very massive and wicked attack on the human creation and upon their nations. The Lord has allowed it to bring forth a course correction on many levels. However, in their arrogance, these globalists have decided that they are gods, with the right and the means to transform the world into a depopulated, freedom-diminished, collection of AI-controlled (Artificial Intelligence) individuals; operating according to their demands, morality, and standards. That is certainly what the ancient prophets, Yeshua, and the book of Revelation indicated would happen … i.e. a wickedly godless global rule operating through fierce oppression against biblical faith. Is this move of darkness, to bring forth the anti-Messiah, being enacted ahead of time? I would say yes … by just a few years. I firmly believe that the Lord intends to bring in His harvest of souls very soon … and then the really ugly stuff will begin. I believe this crisis has the potential of triggering the Lord’s global revival, which is to begin in Israel. The appearance of that time of revival may depend upon how we pray and act during this season of great challenge. Certainly, the Lord needed to discipline His human creation. He will absolutely use this crisis for His purposes. However, woe to those, who created this horror through their allegiance to satan, for the prospering of his reign … along with the purpose of glorying in their own rebellion against YHVH!&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord intended discipline to be accomplished in His judgement against global wickedness … particularly in regard to the sin and duplicity, which is rife in the institutional church. However, these satanic “elites” may have been too presumptuous (and hatefully cruel) in applying their own means and timetable; intending to accomplish their goals against the Lord’s anointed by their own design. Note what scripture says about “going too far” … beyond what the Lord wants accomplished, and when.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Zachariah 1:14-15 (NASB)</strong></p><p><strong>14 Then the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, 15 but I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease. For I was a little angry, but&nbsp;<u>they have increased the calamity</u>.’</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Chronicles 28:9</p><p>“Look,” he said to them, “because of His wrath against Judah, the LORD,&nbsp;<strong><u>the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hands</u>.&nbsp;<u>But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches up to heaven</u>.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Surely, the Lord lifted His hand, so that discipline might come to Israel, to the church, and to the rebellious nations that have not regarded Him, and who turned toward wickedness (child sacrifice through abortion … endorsing and celebrating homosexuality/ transgender … plots against Israel’s survival and inheritance from YHVH, etc.). Having said that, the Lord looks at the hearts and motives of all people. He has seen the vile hatred in the hearts of the elite toward Him and toward His authority … along with their disdain for His Land and people. YHVH has seen their plans for crushing Israel and for all eliminating bible believers everywhere … even cutting off those uncommitted individuals, who might seek the truth, and come to know Him. YHVH has also seen the level of complicity that the leaders of nations, businesses, and institutions have had with satan’s agenda, for creating a sweeping global destruction, in order to enact their rolling takeover. He will deal with this wickedness. I hope it comes by sweeping their feet, and by bringing both a revival, and an amazing cure for this disease in the next couple of weeks. A few days ago, while in prayer, the Lord told me to ask Him to bring forth the “SILVER BULLET” to be applied against this virus attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver bullet may be a medication that quickly heals those suffering from this infection. I pray it is a natural, inexpensive, easily made, and quickly distributed medication … preferably, one that is given to the Israeli research scientists via the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be a double insult against the elite. Let’s pray it into reality; asking the Father to bring it. YHVH could quickly bring this plague to a sudden halt. He is looking for the righteous remnant to do our part. I am continually seeking His more strategy and insight. Let’s all do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love for this to come forth before the end of Passover … when begins next Wednesday night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before I give you a few points for intercession, I want to share a prophetic message that I sent to a dear friend in Israel (who works in healthcare by the way).&nbsp;&nbsp;She reminded me of its pertinency today during a phone call. Read through this and see if you see some connected dots related to this viral crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the message I texted to her:</p><p><strong><em>The Lord just presented this truth to carry into 2020:</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>When He brings you out of something, He does not allow you to choose the way out ... the escape route. He takes you the route that you need most for obtaining maximum blessing and for the most Kingdom growth and glory. He will cause you to walk out of peril by going through what is impossible for you to walk through on your own. The testimony will be supported by the glory derived by you not going under, but rather by you going over/ overcoming the obstacles with His help. ... and thus, by coming through<u>. It will be a gloriously challenging year</u>. Don't be so concerned about WHAT you're going through, but WHY the Lord has brought it for you to experience it. It's for blessings and for you to be enlarged enough in the spirit to be able to hold the immense blessings He wants to give. He doesn't want to destroy us, but to break us, to expand, us and to strengthen us to be able operate in greater blessings with greater truth and greater understanding. Blessed 2020!!</em></strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The Lord will cause us to walk out of this peril by going through what is impossible for us to walk through on our own. HE IS WITH US.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our testimony will come about as we do not “go under” in the midst of the crisis. The Lord holds us up and walks us through the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is enlarging us … not destroying us. He needs to break us in order to expand us. We are being transformed in the process. At the same time, we will be bringing unbelievers into the Kingdom, as they see and hear the message of the Kingdom resonating through our lives while we live in Him.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>THE MAIN ISSUES FOR INTERCESSION: THE COVID-19&nbsp;&nbsp;MOVING THROUGH ISRAEL</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;Here are some of the statistics and information</u>:</strong></p><p>--10 Israeli victims of the virus died Wednesday.&nbsp;The total of all deaths (connected to Covid-19) up to this day is 44. That is an amazing survival/recovery rate, when compared to the rest of the world.</p><p>--Total sick with the virus= 7,851&nbsp;…&nbsp;just a 4.7% increase in cases in 24 hours&nbsp;(that’s a huge improvement)</p><p>--In the ultra-Orthodox community of&nbsp;Bnei Brak alone there are more than 900 people with the infection. They have been evacuating 4500 elderly from that community.</p><p>--Age stats:</p><p>37% of the Israelis infected are under age 30&nbsp;(likely acquired the infection from traveling out of the country)</p><p>15% of the infected are between age 30-39</p><p>13% of the infected are between age 40-49</p><p>That means 65% of those infected in Israel are under age 49. ONLY 38% of those infected are over age 60</p><p>--ONLY 2 of those, who have died, were under the age of 60.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this disease is most lethal for those over age 60.</p><p>--427 Israelis have recovered</p><p>--115 are presently in serious condition</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Other things to note:</u></strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**All Israelis are now to wear masks in public.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that it has been discovered that breathing and talking can transmit the infection, this is an important step.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray that the Israelis will continue to follow these wise instructions, so that the disease will have a chance to die out more quickly, rather than surge in numbers for all statistics.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**Israeli Health Minister, Yaakov Litzman, has the virus, but Bibi Netanyahu has been tested and is negative for COVID-19.&nbsp;Pray that the leaders of Israel will stay healthy. Pray that during this time of quarantine, the leaders will get some divine revelation about how to form a viable, Godly government for Israel. Pray for the security forces to stay healthy, strong and alert.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**Half of those hospitalized in Israel with COVID-19 are from the ultra-orthodox community.</strong></p><p><strong>Israel's ultra-orthodox Haredi community has been facing fines and arrests for ignoring (or resisting) the stringent government regulations that forbid community prayer gatherings/service, and which forbids people from walking more than 100 meters, or 328 feet, outside their home except in emergencies.</strong></p><p><strong>The strongly religious sects do not feel that the State of Israel has the authority to interfere with their life and religious practices. The level of illness in their communities is changing that opinion somewhat.</strong></p><p><strong>Pray for the ultra-Orthodox to get a revelation about the need for them to keep social distance. Their communities are crowded already, but they don’t need to worsen the situation by spreading the disease due to defiance against the authority of the State that is wanting to protect them. Pray for protection of the elderly, weak, and fragile members of the Israeli society. Pray for wisdom to come to the religious leaders.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**Hebrew University is working diligently to find a cure … exploring medicines that could heal the disease.&nbsp;While many are looking for a vaccine, the Israelis are also looking for a cure. If they find one that is effective, this attack could be stopped in its tracks, and the goals of the elite could be thwarted.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**The Technion and the National Coronavirus Technology Center at the Israel Ministry of Defense have created a special sticker by 3D printing, that will overlay the standard masks; increasing the level of protection through special fibers impregnated with disinfectant.&nbsp;Continue to pray that the Israelis would be given witty inventions by YHVH, to bring help and healing to the world.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**To meet the demand for protective masks, a company in Sderot is rising to the occasion. The Sion company will produce 35 million face masks for the Defense Ministry. By the end of this month, 5.5 million N95 masks will be delivered, to be followed by 11 million, non-N95 masks.&nbsp;Pray that ALL necessary medical supplies will be available when needed. Pray that this company stays protected from any rocket fire from Gaza terrorists.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>**The annual Orthodox Christian Easter ceremony of “catching the sacred fire” … which takes places at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher … was scheduled for April 18th. With the COVID-19 challenges and restrictions, that will only involve 10 people this year (following regulated social distancing), rather than many hundreds. The fire, that is brought out of the most sacred place in the church, has always been passed to the pilgrims coming from several nations (largely from Greece, Russia, Georgia and Ukraine). It has been customary for dignitaries from these nations to receive the flame in the church, for them take it back to their nations. With the ban against international travel, and the requirement of all travelers to be quarantined for 14 days after arriving in Israel, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has arranged a clever way to pass on the flames. The dignitaries will arrive in Israel and remain on their planes. The flame will be brought to each of them in special sealed containers, for them to immediately fly back to their countries of origin with their desired treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray that this year, the fire caught in Jerusalem, and transferred around the world, will be the fire of the Holy Spirit, and the revelation of Yeshua. Pray that the realities of the Passover sacrifice and Resurrection Day will have their true meanings understood by multitudes. Pray that the deliverance of Passover would come and manifest in a great healing miracle against COVID-19 in the Land of Israel … as well as the total destruction of this threat there and worldwide.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**Israel is getting hit economically very hard. The Passover and Easter holidays are the busiest times of the year for tourism. Yet, this year, it has all stopped. The streets of the Old City are empty. Tour buses sit empty in parking lots. Hotels are vacant. Restaurants are closed.&nbsp;Pray for the Lord to provide for those, who now have no income. Pray against panic and violence, if this shut down continues. Pray that the shutdown won’t end until it’s really safe to end. Pray that the enemies of Israel would not attack over this holiday season; given that the nation is in a weakened state.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**In an effort to deal with the massive economic impact of COVID-19, a 5-Billion-dollar record setting bond sale took place in Israel.&nbsp;Israel sold $1 billion of 100-year bonds in international markets. They sold $2 billion of 10-year debt, and $2 billion of 30-year bonds. 400 investors from 40 countries bought up the bonds in the high demand sale.&nbsp;I don’t feel good about all these foreign investors owning a piece of Israel … especially if any of those buyers are global elite, or wealthy Islamic businessmen. I don’t like the idea of Israel being indebted to any nation or individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray for the Lord to protect and to provide for Israel. Pray that the nations will not be allowed to steal her prosperity nor gain controlling interest (or access) to the life and people of Israel through these investments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**Some Arabs have responded violently to the isolation restrictions. In the city of Jaffa, some Arab youths protested the limitations put upon all citizens, by throwing Molotov cocktails, starting fires in dumpsters, and by throwing bricks and rocks at first responders. Lawlessness and anarchy broke out between two Arab communities in northern Jerusalem (Kalandiya and Kafr Akab). Armed gangs and groups of Palestinians roamed the streets; trying to block access to the other community. Apparently, the violence broke out because of accusations that one community was trying to infect the other when two people were found to have COVID-19. An exchange of gunfire between the opposing groups, caused the PA security forces to come into the area to shut down the escalating violence.&nbsp;Pray for the Lord to dump a large bucket of living water on these riots and protests. Pray for Him to pour out His Spirit upon the Islamic Arab communities to bring them out of the bondage, blindness, and violence of that demonic faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray protection over all the Israelis, if this violence should increase as the weeks pass, and economic conditions worsen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**This Wednesday evening, in the midst of the COVID-19 battle, the Passover begins. It will be a Passover like none other. The Seder meal is an intimate, big family event, but this year, everyone must conduct the Seder in their own homes; away from the extended family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray for the most intimate Passover meal that the Jewish people have ever experienced. Pray for Yeshua to visit, be felt, and be recognized in every Jewish home. When they drink the cup of Redemption, may they recognize the Redeemer.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they open the door to let the prophet Elijah in, may the Holy Spirit blow in tangibly. When the Afikomen matza is broken, wrapped, hidden, bought back, and eaten, may they KNOW, who the Lamb of God truly is. On the Day of First Fruits, may the Resurrection Day of the Messiah reveal Him to the Jewish people as the First Fruit, risen from death.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the conclusion of Passover, may this COVID-19 threat be washed away permanently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are so many other things that I could present to you for prayer, but I need to stop there and send this to your inboxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;As promised at the beginning of this writing, I have put long list of possible links at the bottom of this page, for you to explore. Some will supply you with some things to think about and to pray about. Some may be controversial. Some are articles about issues and concerns that may answer some of the questions that you have been asking me through your emails and texts. The reality in all this is that there truly are real conspiracies operating around the world … not all are hype, hoax, or nonsensical theories.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the ones most ardently decried by the global Left (and the media), and by the humanist elite, likely bear some important truth that they don’t want us to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord knows exactly what is going on, who is doing what, and what the solution might be. We have to seek Him continually for truth, and then listen for His answers, rather than reacting. Some answers may be concealed until we get beyond this life and into the next one. What we do know for certain, we must cling to and share. YESHUA IS THE MESSIAH!&nbsp;&nbsp;HE IS RETURNING!&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR FATHER GOD IS TOTALLY IN CONTROL.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL ALWAYS BE LEADING US IN HIS TRUTH AS WE LISTEN AND FOLLOW.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do we share those profound realities?&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, while walking in our neighborhood with my husband, the Lord repeated something to me that I had been hearing for the past several weeks. “When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord raises up a standard.” All of a sudden it was clear. We were to create a banner of faith to display for our neighborhood. I went on-line and ordered a 4x8 foot, outdoor vinyl, banner that I designed.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will hang it from the roof portion of our garage when it arrives later this week. On the light blue banner there is a big beaming lighthouse, accompanied by these words:&nbsp;</p><p>THE LORD IS OUR STRENGTH AND OUR REFUGE. HE WILL SAFE US.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ordered a second, identical banner, to display at the hospital where my husband works. Please pray for him and for all the staff at the hospital as they care for those stricken and afraid. Pray for strength and endurance for all the caregivers. Ask for the Lord to pour out His fire of love and holiness upon all the hospitals and healthcare facilities, to incinerate this virus. Keep all of us covered with the blood of Yeshua. Greater is HE WHO IS IN US, than this threat that surrounds and which intends to destroy us. This should be our finest hour. Bring on those miracles and revelations. Expose those hidden things and overturn the plans of the evil one. As we do our part, the Lord will do His. What we can’t handle, He will deal with effectively. No fear! Evil will not ultimately win. Regarding those, who have aligned themselves with satan and his kingdom … and who have conspired to destroy the world’s populations, and to seize freedom; taking control of all global life … this is what the Lord God of Israel says in Isaiah 13:11 (NASB):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>11 I will punish the world for its evil, and&nbsp;<u>the wicked for their iniquity</u>.&nbsp;<u>I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant and&nbsp;humiliate the pride of tyrants</u>.</em></strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The Luciferian tyrants of the globe WILL BE TAKEN DOWN at some point by the hand of YHVH. Meanwhile, let’s rejoice that this virus is stopping international travel … halting a great deal of illegal drug transport and sex trafficking. Non-essential businesses are closed … meaning that the gambling casinos and porn shops are closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion clinics have shut down. Evil may still be moving underground, but some of the arrogant, above ground, rebellion is being held back by this virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is so encouraging.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now rest in the One, who is able to keep us safe in this storm, and to enable us to walk on water in the midst of the waves.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Websites - for your consideration...

President Obama, Pope Benedict XVI, along with a significant host of other powerful world leaders, clamor once and for all for a two-state solution. They have heightened concern that the writing is on the 403-mile wall currently protecting the people of Israel from Palestinian terror that a Middle East war is imminent.</p><p>As the clock rapidly ticks toward what will likely be the prophetic Psalm 83 showdown, Israel circles the wagons in preparation for a multi-front confederate conflict with its ancient enemies, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu loosens his grip from the thorny Obama olive branch of “Engagement.”</p><p>Currently, the international prescription for two states comprised of the Jews of Israel and Palestinians living autonomously and peacefully side by side requires Israel to destroy outposts, freeze settlements, forfeit land acquired after 1967, divide Jerusalem and allow Palestinian refugees to homestead the Holy Land. These refugees number in the millions, cannot obtain citizenship in the surrounding Arab nations and represent a second-generation population that hates and blames the Jews for their impoverished existence. The ploy of the enemies of Israel has been to banner the plight of these Palestinians as the justification for Islamic jihad against Israel and her supporters.</p><p>It is quite apparent that the world has become empathetic to the Palestinian plight but apathetic to God’s foreign policy contained in Genesis 12:3 and the one-state solution prescribed in Jeremiah 12:14–17. Genesis 12:3 bestows blessings upon those that bless the Israeli descendants of Abraham but conversely must curse those populations that oppose them. Jeremiah 12:15–17 follows stride by declaring that God would have compassion on the pro- Israel populations, but “will utterly pluck up and destroy” Israel ‘s neighbors who fail to operate in compliance with God’s roadmap for peace.</p><h3>God’s peace&nbsp;plan</h3><p>The Bible foretold in Isaiah 11:11, Ezekiel 37:12, Deuteronomy 30:3–5 and elsewhere of a time when the Jews would be brought back into the Promised Land from the nations of the world. This regathering began 61 years ago on May 14, 1948, and is ongoing today. Possessing omniscient foresight, God foreknew that an Arab-Israeli conflict would erupt as a result.</p><p>Jeremiah 12:14–17 tells us that as the time drew near for the return of the Jews into Israel the landscape of the Middle East would undergo a geopolitical facelift as God intended to restore Arabs, Persians and Jews back into the historical homes of their ancestral heritages. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1917, we see this turn of geopolitical events take place as one by one the Arab, Persian and Jewish states emerged.</p><ul><li><strong>Afghanistan 1919</strong></li><li><strong>Egypt 1922</strong></li><li><strong>Saudi Arabia &amp; Iraq 1932</strong></li><li><strong>Iran 1935</strong></li><li><strong>Lebanon 1943</strong></li><li><strong>Syria &amp; Jordan 1946</strong></li><li><strong>Israel 1948</strong></li></ul><p>Jeremiah’s passages make it clear that God would import the Jews into Israel and export the Arabs and Persians out of Israel when the time came for the implementation of God’s one-state solution. Jeremiah 12:14 refers to the Arab and Persian populations as “My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit,” alluding to the Promised Land given to the Jewish Patriarch Abraham in Genesis 15:18. As stated prior, God intended to have compassion on those populations that would operate in compliance with His divine plan.</p><p>As I point out in my book, “Isralestine the Ancient Blueprints of the Future Middle East,” many predominately Islamic populations will fail to comply. These nations and/or terrorist entities are described in Psalm 83 and Ezekiel 38 and include but are not limited to: Palestinians, Syrians, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iranians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Saudis, Egyptians, Libyans and Turks.</p><h3>The Saudi peace&nbsp;plan</h3><p>For even your brothers, the house of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously with you; Yes, they have called a multitude after you. Do not believe them, Even though they speak smooth words to you. (Jeremiah 12:6; NKJV)</p><p>In the above passage Jeremiah appears to issue a stern warning to the modern-day state of Israel not to believe the smooth words of the descendants of their ancestral brothers. Without going into a detailed Bible study, the abbreviated interpretation is likely as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Tents of Edom — Palestinians, Southern Jordan</strong></li><li><strong>Ishmaelites — Saudi Arabia (Ishmael Father of Arabs)</strong></li><li><strong>Moab — Palestinians, Central Jordan</strong></li><li><strong>Hagrites — Hagarenes — Egyptians</strong></li><li><strong>Gebal — Hezbollah, Lebannon</strong></li><li><strong>Ammon — Palestinians, Jordan</strong></li><li><strong>Philistia — Hamas, Gaza Strip</strong></li><li><strong>Amalek — Arabs of Siani</strong></li><li><strong>Tyre — Lebannon, Hezbollah</strong></li><li><strong>Assyria — Syria, Northern Iraq</strong></li></ul><p>The subjects of the prophecy for the most part are the Jews, Saudis and Palestinians. The “brothers” of the Jews from the “house of” their Hebrew fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were Ishmael and Esau. Ishmael was the half brother of Isaac, and Esau was the twin brother of Jacob. Jacob was renamed Israel in Genesis 32:28, and Esau was also referred to as Edom in Genesis 36:1, 9. Both Ishmael in Genesis 21:18 and Esau in Genesis 25:23 were promised to father nations. Ishmael is generally associated today with Saudi Arabia, and Esau with the Palestinians.</p><p>The “multitude” formed by the “brothers” Ishmael and Edom is most likely the confederacy tabled below contained in Psalm 83 that ultimately seeks to destroy the modern-day Jewish state, “that the name Israel be remembered no more” (Psalm 83:4).</p><p>The “smooth words” are deceptive and the Jews are cautioned not to trust them. They are likely penned in the Saudi Mideast peace plan initiated at the Beirut Summit of the Arab League in March of 2002. This Saudi peace initiative calls for a two-state solution that embraces and strongly favors the Palestinian plight. In a nutshell it requires Israel to withdraw from the territories acquired in the aftermath of the “Six-Day” war in June of 1967 to provide for the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Furthermore, it calls for the return of millions of Palestinian refugees into Israel. In return, Arab states, like those listed in Psalm 83, would establish normal relations with Israel.</p><p>Sounds pretty smooth on the surface, but in application it puts Israel in harm’s way. Surrendering land like the Golan Heights would compromise Israel’s security from external attacks, and assimilating refugees who hate Israel would subject the Jewish state to terrorism and turmoil from within. The bottom line is that the Arabs don’t want peace with the Jews; they want another Arab state called Palestine and they feel the only way to ultimately achieve this goal is to destroy modern-day Israel.

Graham, President Reagan’s top science adviser and the chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack, will update the committee Thursday morning.</p><p>The radical Shiite regime has conducted successful tests to determine if its Shahab-3 ballistic missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, can be detonated by a remote-control device while still in high-altitude flight, Graham said in his report.</p><p>Graham warned in 2005 that Iran was not only covertly developing nuclear weapons, but was already testing ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy America’s technical infrastructure with the aim of neutralizing the world’s lone superpower.</p><p>Graham said then there was no other plausible explanation for such tests than preparation for the deployment of electromagnetic pulse weapons — even one of which could knock out America’s critical electrical and technological infrastructure, effectively sending the continental U.S. back to the 19th century with a recovery time of months or years.</p><p>Iran would have that capability — at least theoretically — as soon as it has one nuclear bomb ready to arm such a missile.</p><p>The stunning report was first published in Joseph Farah’s G2 Bulletin, the premium, online intelligence newsletter published by WND’s founder.</p><p>Iran surprised intelligence analysts by describing the mid-flight detonations of missiles fired from ships on the Caspian Sea as “successful” tests. Even primitive Scud missiles could be used for this purpose. And top U.S. intelligence officials reminded members of Congress that there is a glut of these missiles on the world market. They are currently being bought and sold for about $100,000 apiece.</p><p>Others agree with Graham’s sobering assessment.</p><blockquote>“A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead ‘on target’ with a Scud, but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere,” wrote Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., in the Washington Post in 2005 after reading Graham’s report. “No need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city. Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters — al-Qaida is believed to own about 80 such vessels — and make sure to get it a few miles in the air.”</blockquote><p>The Iranian missile tests were more sophisticated and capable of detonation at higher elevations — making them more dangerous.</p><p>Detonated at a height of 60 to 500 kilometers above the continental U.S., one nuclear warhead could cripple the country — knocking out electrical power and circuit boards and rendering the U.S. domestic communications impotent.</p><p>In 2005, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security chaired by Kyl, held a hearing on the electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, threat.</p><p>“An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the American homeland, said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing, is one of only a few ways that the United States could be defeated by its enemies — terrorist or otherwise,” wrote Kyl “And it is probably the easiest. A single Scud missile, carrying a single nuclear weapon, detonated at the appropriate altitude, would interact with the Earth’s atmosphere, producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light. Depending on the location and size of the blast, the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental United States, for months if not years.”</p><p>The purpose of an EMP attack, unlike a nuclear attack on land, is not to kill people, but “to kill electrons,” as Graham explained. He serves as chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack and was director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p><p>Graham told WND he could think of no other reason for Iran to be experimenting with mid-air detonation of missiles than for the planning of an EMP-style attack.</p><p>“EMP offers a bigger bang for the buck,” he said. He also suggested such an attack makes a U.S. nuclear response against a suspected enemy less likely than would the detonation of a nuclear bomb in a major U.S. city.</p><p>A 2004 report by the commission found “several potential adversaries have or can acquire the capability to attack the United States with a high-altitude nuclear weapons-generated electromagnetic pulse (EMP). A determined adversary can achieve an EMP attack capability without having a high level of sophistication.”</p><p>“EMP is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences,” the report said. “EMP will cover the wide geographic region within line of sight to the nuclear weapon. It has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures and thus to the very fabric of U.S. society, as well as to the ability of the United States and Western nations to project influence and military power.”</p><p>The major impact of EMP weapons is on electronics, “so pervasive in all aspects of our society and military, coupled through critical infrastructures,” explained the report.</p><p>“Their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation,” Lowell Wood, acting chairman of the commission, told members of Congress.</p><p>The commission report went so far as to suggest, in its opening sentence, that an EMP attack “might result in the defeat of our military forces.”</p><p>“Briefly, a single nuclear weapon exploded at high altitude above the United States will interact with the Earth’s atmosphere, ionosphere and magnetic field to produce an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation down to the Earth and additionally create electrical currents in the Earth,” said the report. “EMP effects are both direct and indirect.</p><p>The former are due to electrical systems, and the latter arise from the damage that ‘shocked’ — upset, damaged and destroyed — electronics controls then inflict on the systems in which they are embedded. The indirect effects can be even more severe than the direct effects.”</p><p>The EMP threat is not a new one considered by U.S. defense planners. The Soviet Union had experimented with the idea as a kind of super-weapon against the U.S.</p><p>“What is different now is that some potential sources of EMP threats are difficult to deter — they can be terrorist groups that have no state identity, have only one or a few weapons and are motivated to attack the U.S. without regard for their own safety,” explains the commission report. “Rogue states, such as North Korea and Iran, may also be developing the capability to pose an EMP threat to the United States and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter.”</p><p>Graham describes the potential “cascading effect” of an EMP attack. If electrical power is knocked out and circuit boards fried, telecommunications are disrupted, energy deliveries are impeded, the financial system breaks down, food, water and gasoline become scarce.</p><p>As Kyl put it: “Few if any people would die right away. But the loss of power would have a cascading effect on all aspects of U.S. society. Communication would be largely impossible. Lack of refrigeration would leave food rotting in warehouses, exacerbated by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still working simply ran out of gas (which is pumped with electricity). The inability to sanitize and distribute water would quickly threaten public health, not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires, which would rage unchecked. And as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters, such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order.”</p><p>“American society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own Achilles’ heel of vulnerability, ironically much greater than those of other, less developed nations,” the senator wrote.</p><p>“When deprived of power, we are in many ways helpless, as the New York City blackout made clear. In that case, power was restored quickly because adjacent areas could provide help.</p><p>But a large-scale burnout caused by a broad EMP attack would create a much more difficult situation. Not only would there be nobody nearby to help, it could take years to replace destroyed equipment.”</p><p>The commission said hardening key infrastructure systems and procuring vital backup equipment such as transformers is both feasible and — compared with the threat — relatively inexpensive.</p><p>“But it will take leadership by the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, and other federal agencies, along with support from Congress, all of which have yet to materialize,” wrote Kyl, so far the only elected official blowing the whistle this alarming development.</p><p>Kyl concluded in his report: “The Sept. 11 commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of ‘imagination.’ No one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on Sept. 11. Today few Americans can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring our society to its knees by destroying everything we rely on that runs on electricity. But this time we’ve been warned, and we’d better be prepared to respond.”</p>	#FF4600	80	article	\N	\N	\N	t

It is the popular belief that the Bible and science are at odds, that intelligence is on the side of unbelief, and that only childish or sentimental or uneducated people still trust the contents of the Bible (ref.2, p.20). This worldview has caused a prejudice that keeps many from even considering the legitimacy of accurate science being in the Bible. Examining the evidence before deciding will allow for a fair hearing on the subject.</p><p>Science, which is knowledge, is the organized body of observation and experiment on present (repeatable) processes. Science can examine and analyze present processes and materials, but science cannot say conclusively how things came into existence because origins are not subject to experimental verification. Science can only show what can be verified now, not what has happened in the past. That task is for historians, biographers, and autobiographers.</p><p>Science merely documents nature, while God is the reality lying behind all phenomena, supporting them, directing them, and explaining them. We must be ready to hear the voice of science and the voice of scripture on common matters. Scientific knowledge is invaluable for a knowledge of the Bible–at least to know it fully and completely (ref.2, p.25).</p><p>Science is simply the process of discovering the mechanisms of nature which God has put in place to make our universe work as it does. Science has opened up the secrets and meaning of nature, the creation of God. Both science and theology deal with the same universe, one part is physical and the other invisible. Through the scriptures we discover the origin, purpose, and end of the created universe. The reliability of the scriptures can be validated by logical examination of evidence, just as valid scientific data can. Through science we find clues, analogies, and confirmations of the existence and nature of the invisible universe (ref.2, p.28).</p><p>If one were to put into operation an automotive plant so fixed that as the finished products were driven off the assembly line they dropped into the maws of the huge smelter from which they were originally derived, it would be judged as a case of a perverted and fantastic mentality. Yet this is precisely the type of analogy much of modern science is following. It is the intent of science to amass all the facts about the universe in its countless facets; it is the function of theology to give these data their purpose and theological ordering (ref.2, p.27).</p><h3>THE FIVE FUNDAMENTALS OF&nbsp;SCIENCE</h3><p>After practically a lifetime of study, Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), the famous British philosopher, declared that there are basically five fundamentals of science: time, force, action, space, and matter. Little did Spencer realize he was but echoing what had been written by a man more than 3,000 years prior to him! That man was Moses, his book was Genesis, and his statement: “In the beginning [time] God [force] created [action] the heavens [space] and the earth [matter]” (Genesis 1:1). Thus, with the very first verse of the Bible, it becomes crystal clear to the open-minded inquirer that there is something special, something unique, about the sacred text. A closer examination of the Book reveals many startling scientific facts, placed there hundreds or thousands of years before they were known to the modern scientific mind–buried like precious gems within the text of the Bible (ref.1, vol.1, les.#9, p.33).</p><h3>Astronomy</h3><p>Job states, in speaking of God, that “He stretcheth out the north over the empty space, and hangs the earth upon nothing” (Job 26:7). That, of course, is a well-known fact today. The earth is literally “hanging upon nothing.” But we must remember that this was not the concept of Job’s day. Men in Job’s time felt the earth was possibly suspended on the backs of four elephants, which stood on the back of a giant turtle! Or, they felt that the earth was suspended upon the shoulders of a supernaturally strong man! There were many odd views about the condition of the earth, but none stated the matter in the clear and correct manner as does Job. A lucky guess–when everyone else was wrong?</p><p>Isaiah says, “It is he [God] who sits upon the circle of the earth ” (Isaiah 40: 22).</p><p>The Hebrew word Isaiah used for “circle” means literally something with “roundness” or “spherically.” Of course, the people of Isaiah’s time (and for many generations to come) thought the earth was flat, not spherical. Another lucky guess?</p><p>Psalm 19:5–6 contains several interesting facts. In speaking of the sun, the psalmist says that “His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and the circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.”</p><p>For many years, Bible critics scoffed at the Bible stating that this verse taught the old false doctrine that the sun revolves around the earth! Then, it was recently discovered that the sun is, in fact, moving through space. It is not stationary, as was once thought. In fact, it is estimated to be moving through space at about 600,000 miles per hour, in an orbit so large it would take an estimated 200,000,000 years just to complete one orbit! Another lucky guess?</p><p>There is another gem tucked away in these two verses. The writer hints at the fact that the sun is the source of the energy of the earth (“and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof”). An amazing statement, considering when it was written, is it not?</p><h3>Oceanography</h3><p>Solomon, long ago wrote, “All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, there they go again” (Ecclesiastes 1:7). The Mississippi River, when running at an average rate of flow, dumps approximately 6,052,500 gallons of water into the Gulf of Mexico–per second. Where does all that water go? And remember, this is just the water from one river! The answer, of course, lies in the hydrologic cycle, of which the Bible speaks. Ecclesiastes 11:3a states that “if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.” Amos 9:6b reminds us that “he…called for the waters of the sea, and poured them out upon the face of the earth; the lord is his name.”</p><p>The idea of a complete water cycle was not fully understood or accepted until the 16th and 17th centuries. The first substantial evidence came from the experiments of Pierre Perrault and Edme Maroitte. Astronomer Edmund Halley also contributed valuable data to the concept of a complete water cycle. More than 2,000 years prior to their discoveries, however, the scriptures indicated a water cycle. How? Just a lucky guess?</p><p>Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806–1873) was once confined to bed during a lengthy illness. His son, who had been asked to read for him from the Bible, turned to Psalm 8 and upon reading verse 8, drew his father’s immediate attention. The verse reads, “The birds of the heaven, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the seas.” It had never been noticed by Maury before. Using this verse he decided to find the “paths of the seas.”</p><p>Indeed, he found just that! He was the first (of whom we have a written record) to recognize that the seas were circulating systems with interaction between wind and water. His book on physical oceanography is still considered a basic text for studies of that sort. The book, Matthew Fontaine Maury: Pathfinder of the Seas, by C. S. Lewis (published in 1927 by the U.S. Naval Institute), recounts the entire story. Maury “took God at His Word” and found that Word to be fully accurate!</p><p>Job was asked by God (Job 38:16), “Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?” The Hebrew word for “recesses” (or “trenches”) refers to that which is “hidden, and known only by investigation.” What then were these “recesses of the deep” (the Hebrew for “deep” is the word for seas or oceans)?</p><p>Man, in previous centuries, thought of the seashore as nothing but a shallow, sandy extension from one continent to another. Then, in 1873 a team of British scientists searching in the Pacific Ocean found a “recess” five and one-half miles deep. Later, another team of scientists found in the Pacific Ocean a trench more than six miles deep! How did Job know the recesses of the deep were there, when they were not discovered for centuries?</p><h3>The Science of&nbsp;Physics</h3><p>Moses writes, “…and the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them” (Genesis 2:1). This is an interesting statement because Moses chose the Hebrew past definite tense for the verb “finished,” indicating an action completed in the past, never again to occur. That is exactly what the First Law of Thermodynamics says! This law (often called the Law of the Conservation of Energy and/or Matter) states that neither matter nor energy can be created or destroyed. How did Moses know?</p><p>In three places the Bible affirms that the earth is wearing out. Isaiah 51:6, Psalms 102:26, and Hebrews 1:11 all say that “…the earth will wear out like a garment.”</p><p>This is precisely what the Second Law of Thermodynamics says: everything is running down, wearing out; energy is becoming less and less available for use; entropy (a measure of randomness, disorderliness, lack of structure) is increasing</p><p>That, of course, means the universe eventually will “wear out.” The Bible writers knew it, and stated it clearly. We did not discover it until a few years back. How did the Bible writers know?</p><h3>The Science of&nbsp;Medicine</h3><p>Moses told the Israelites that “the life of the flesh is in the blood” (Leviticus 17:11–14). Indeed, Moses was correct. Because the red blood cells can carry oxygen (due to hemoglobin in the cells), life is made possible.</p><p>In fact, human red blood cells can carry 270 million molecules of hemoglobin each. If there were any less, there would not be enough residual oxygen available to sustain life after, say, a good sneeze, or a hard pat on the back! We know today that “the life of the flesh is in the blood.” But it was not known even as recently as in George Washington’s day. He was bled to death through the bloodletting process of that day’s doctors. How was Moses so accurate?</p><p>According to the Old Testament, circumcision was to be performed on the eighth day of a newborn male’s life (Genesis 17:12). Why the eighth day?</p><p>In 1935, Professor H. Dam proposed the name “Vitamin K” for the factor in foods that helped prevent hemorrhaging in baby chicks. We now know that Vitamin K is responsible for the production of prothrombin by the liver. If Vitamin K is deficient, there will be a prothrombin deficiency and hemorrhaging may occur, since both Vitamin K and prothrombin are necessary for proper blood clotting. Oddly enough, it is only on the fifth through the seventh days of the newborn male’s life that Vitamin K begins to be produced (usually produced by bacteria in the intestinal tract). It is only on the eighth day that the percentage of prothrombin climbs above 100%!</p><p>The only day in the entire life of the newborn that the blood-clotting element prothrombin is above 100% is day eight. Therefore, the best day for circumcision is the eighth day! Did Moses have access to modern-day scientific knowledge, or did God tell him to write this?</p><p>Genesis 3:15 says, “…between her seed and thy seed,” revealing that a female (as well as a male) possesses the seed of life. Such, however, was not believed in Moses’ day, or even until recently. Ancient writers believed that only the male possesses the seed of life, and that the female was nothing more than a “glorified incubator.” One writer even suggested that you could deposit the male semen in the warm mud, and the result would be the same as depositing it in the human female! How was Genesis so accurate?</p><h3>The Science of&nbsp;Biology</h3><p>In the field of biology, one of the most commonly accepted and widely used laws of science is the Law of Biogenesis. This law was set forth many years ago to dictate what both theory and experimental evidence showed to be true among living organisms–that life comes only from preceding life and perpetuates itself by reproducing only its own kind or type. As Dr. David Kirk has correctly stated, “By the end of the nineteenth century there was a general agreement that life cannot arise from the non-living under conditions that now exist upon our planet. The dictum ‘All life from preexisting life’ became the dogma of modern biology, from which no reasonable man could be expected to dissent” (ref.7). Such men as Francesco Redi (1688), Lazarro Spallanzani (1799), Louis Pasteur (1860), and Rudolph Virchow (1858) first carried out the experiments which formed the ultimate basis of this law. It was Virchow who documented that cells do not arise from formless matter, but instead come only from preexisting cells (ref.1, vol.IX, les.#6, p.22). This law has no exceptions. (This law, by the way, is one of the major flaws in the theory of evolution!)</p><p>Thousands of years before the “Law of Biogenesis,” Moses declared that things reproduce “after their kind” (Genesis 1:11–12, 21, 24). You do not get bananas from corn stalks, buffaloes from zebras, or dogs from cats. Moses was right on target, but how did he know these things, since the science of genetics was not instituted until the year 1900?</p><p>Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15:39, states that there are four fleshes–those of men, beasts, birds, and fishes. Today, every evolutionist acknowledges this truth. These fleshes are different indeed in their biochemical makeup. But how did Paul, an itinerant preacher, know this?</p><p>Paul also said that it is God who gives all life (Acts 17:25). For centuries men tried to prove spontaneous generation true; they attempted to “create” life through naturalistic process, yet always without success. Men may alter the state that life is, but they cannot create it. But, how did Paul know this almost 2,000 years ago? One of those lucky guesses (ref.1, vol.1, les.#9, p.33)?</p><h3>Geology</h3><p>The worldwide flood of Noah’s time (Genesis 1:2,6,9; 7:11–24) has been ridiculed often.</p><p>In 1885, Edward Suess was one of the first geologists to publish a study based on the geologic framework of all countries. His research, especially in his observations of the world’s mountain ranges, led to his discovery that all land surfaces had been under water. This explains why you find shells on the tops of mountains. Coincidence?</p><p>Many huge fossil beds have been found where great numbers of many different types of animals were together. The Flood explains this.</p><p>As waters rose, animals sought higher ground and eventually were all together, then were swept off together where currents deposited them along with loads of sediment.</p><p>The evidence of quickly-frozen Mammoths in Siberia is in favor of the Flood.</p><p>The Grand Canyon is evidence of the Flood: water cut through material that was not yet consolidated after it had been deposited by the Flood.</p><p>Ernst Mayr, a leading taxonomist, lists only 17,600 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. How would you get all those animals in the Ark?</p><p>Taking sheep as the average size for the animals, you can fit 240 sheep into a two-level boxcar.</p><p>The Ark was a huge box with enough space for 522 boxcars (the measurements are in Genesis 6:15).</p><p>This means all the animals would fit, leaving plenty of space for food and people.</p><p>So, maybe the Flood and Noah’s Ark are not so far-fetched after all?</p><h3>ARCHAEOLOGY</h3><p>The Bible is filled with references to actual cities, places, mountains, rivers, and civilizations. Archaeology (the study of history by means of uncovering ancient ruins) has confirmed the Bible record time and time again.</p><p>Civilization began in Mesopotamia: the Fertile Crescent has been proved to be the cradle of civilization.</p><p>Long lives of patriarchs before the flood: Archaeology has revealed men living great lengths of time.</p><p>The Sumerians lived in ancient Mesopotamia (sometimes called “the cradle of civilization”) from 4000 to 3000 B.C.&nbsp;, and seem to have been the oldest people to make use of writing. These people made contributions to many areas which still influence us today in Astronomy, Mathematics, Geometry, Fine Arts, and Architecture. Their day was divided into two 12-hour segments, and their architecture may have been responsible for constructing the famous “Tower of Babel” (ref.4, pp.9–14), from which all languages seem to have originated (ref.6, p.47). Cuneiform from excavations of the capital city of Mari has produced records of familiar Biblical names such as Peleg, Serug, Nahor, and Terah, as well as the city of Haran where Abraham lived, and the city of “Ur of Chaldees” where he lived in his youth (ref.5, pp.26–28). From these excavations archaeologists have recovered a record called The Sumerian King List, which tells of kings reigning for hundreds of years. The Bible is pretty conservative compared to these accounts, and suggests that before the Flood there was a water canopy around the earth which created a greenhouse effect, removing the harmful rays of the sun (see Genesis 2:6–14).</p><p>The Great Flood: Archaeologists have found many accounts of a Great Flood which are amazingly parallel to the Bible (Genesis 6–8). The most striking similarities are: divine judgment; a hero who constructs a boat; even the sending out of birds. Mere coincidence?</p><p>Today, many believe that Noah’s actual Ark is still in existence on Mt. Ararat in Turkey. Some claim to have seen it. Due to its being under snow most of the time, and being located close to the Russian border, it has been extremely difficult to prove this conclusively.</p><p>Stories like the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1–9); Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18–19); and Jericho (Joshua 6) are no longer regarded as myths. They have been proved by archaeology.</p><h3>Numerics</h3><p>In 1882, Ivan Panin, a Russian immigrant, had just graduated from Harvard. A brilliant mathematician, multi-lingual scholar (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek), and a literary figure, he had traveled as an agnostic and had lectured often on atheism. He began studying the Bible in the original languages, of which he was fluent.</p><p>Now, both Hebrew and Greek are unique in that they do not use special symbols for their numbering system, but instead use the letters of their alphabets to represent numbers. Each letter can actually represent a number, too.</p><p>Aware of the numerical values of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets, Panin experimented one day by replacing the letters with their corresponding numbers in the scriptures. Suddenly, his trained mind saw a mathematical pattern. The verses he had studied bore unmistakable evidence of “an elaborate mathematical pattern, far beyond random chance, or human ability to construct!” This study marked a turning point in his career, and from that time until his death in 1942, he devoted his entire life to the study of Bible numerics. He later supplied the Nobel Research Foundation with over 43,000 sheets of his studies accompanied by his statement that this was his evidence that the Bible was the Word of God. The Foundation acknowledged, ” investigation has proceeded, we find the evidence overwhelming in favor of such a statement.” Panin found that patterns of prime numbers, such as 11, 13, 17, 23, “but especially 7,” were found in great clusters. When you add up the sum of all numerical values for different words, sentences, paragraphs, passages, and whole books, you find the same pattern in each of these forms:</p><ul><li>The number of words in a vocabulary divides by 7.</li><li>The number of proper names, both male and female, divides by 7.</li><li>The number of words that begin with a vowel, or a consonant, divides by 7.</li><li>The number of nouns is divisible by 7, as are the words that are not.</li><li>The same for words that occur more than once in a sentence, paragraph, book, or the whole Bible are divisible by 7.</li><li>Even the number of words beginning with each letter of the alphabet are divisible by 7.</li><li>And on and on the list goes!</li></ul><h4>Some examples&nbsp;are:</h4><p>Genesis 1:1, the very first sentence in the Bible, states, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” In the Hebrew, that comes out exactly 7 words that have exactly 28 (4 x 7) letters, 3 nouns (God, Heaven, and Earth), 1 Hebrew verb (created). Taking the letters of the nouns and substituting their numerical equivalents and adding them up, you get 777 (111 x 7)! The verb had a numerical value of 203 (29 x 7). This process can be carried out as far as you want to go!</p><p>Matthew 1:1–11 has 49 words (7 x 7) in the original Greek, with 28 words that begin with a vowel (4 x 7), and the remaining 21 (3 x 7) begin with a consonant, 7 end with a vowel, and 42 end with a consonant (6 x 7). The 49 words have 266 letters (38 x 7); 140 are vowels (20 x 7); 126 are consonants (18 x 7). Of these 49 words, 14 occur only once (2 x 7); 35 occur more than once (5 x 7); 42 are nouns (6 x 7) that have exactly 49 letters (7 x 7). Male names occur 56 times (8 x 7), and women’s names appear 3 times (a prime number), and the letters of their names add up to 14. How far do you want to check it? It keeps coming out the same! Every word, chapter, and book in the Bible checks out this way.</p><p>The Bible has its own built-in self-checking mechanism against someone tampering with it! Take out one letter and it damages the whole pattern! How could mere fishermen and tax collectors have conjured up something as remarkable as this mathematical pattern (ref.3)? One mind, one author–one God; many different writers–but one Writer! Can you imagine the kind of Mind that would do this, and not even care if you found out?</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>These items are just a meager sampling of the science in the Bible.</p><p>How did the writers have this scientific foreknowledge?</p><p><strong>Simple: God had them put it there, through divine revelation!</strong></p><p>All conflict between science and the Bible falls into the realm of interpretation of facts–which interpretation is based upon assumptions (assumptions that can be in error!). No fact of science is in conflict with the scriptures! To set science against theology is simply to oppose Creation to Revelation, and Nature to Redemption. It is the uniform testimony of scripture that the God and Messiah of Creation are the God and Messiah of Redemption. It is the interest of science to amass all the facts about the universe in its countless facets; it is the function of the Bible to give these data their purpose and theological orderings.</p><p>Science without scripture sets forth the universal scheme as blind, meaningless, and purposeless, never knowing of an hour of creation, or consummation, and in the perspective of an infinity of years and an immensity of space our human hopes, joys, tragedies, aspirations, civilizations, intellectual and artistic achievements are meaningless, insignificant and trivial. Science in harmony with scripture reveals the universal scheme as meaningful and purposeful, and human life, with all its hopes, joys, tragedies, aspirations, civilizations, and intellectual and artistic achievements, becomes the very center of the universe. It is the insistence of the biblical revelation that God is the God of all humanity, of all the world, and of all the universe.</p><p>The more one studies the Bible, from any perspective (Science, History, Prophecy, Numerology, etc.), the more its reliability is established! You can put any test that you want on this book and nothing is even in the same class. No other work of man in any language even faintly resembles the intricate structure and design of the Bible. The Bible is not just a book–it is God who has spoken in history and presents His Truths of the invisible or spiritual side of the universe. These spiritual truths are just as “true” as God’s physical truths that science documents for us. Truth is truth and facts are facts no matter who develops them! The Bible will stand, and has stood, the test of time and is worthy of your investigation. The truth welcomes examination. Find out for yourself: Is the Bible what it says it is, the Word of God? Or, is it just another book in a sea of books?</p><h3>What If?</h3><p>If all the physical things the Bible says can be proved to be true, then what about the spiritual things? Are they not true also?</p><p>The Bible also says that each of us will live eternally, either in heaven or hell, depending on whether we obey God. The Bible says we must: believe (Romans 10:17), repent (turn from sin–Romans 3:23; Acts 17:30), confess Yeshua as the Son of God (Romans 10:10), be baptized into Messiah for the remission of sins (Galatians 3:27; Acts 2:38; Mark 16:16), and be faithful until death (Revelation 2:10). If you were to die right now, would you go to heaven or hell? Please ask yourself: If all the historical, scientific, and prophetic statements in the Bible are true and accurate, then what about <strong>what the bible says about your having eternal life (or death) and about the choices you make (or do not make) now that can affect your eternal future?</strong> It is in your best interest to study it and find out what God requires of those who would be His children (Romans 8:14–16). Do you not think it is worth examining the Bible to see if it is in fact the Word of God, and to see what you must do to receive eternal life from God?</p><p>Want to know more?

One would expect just the opposite.</p><p>There are many reasons why this book results in a special blessing to those that take the time to really learn it. One of the most basic blessings of Revelation is that you will need to explore so many other books in the Bible to understand it.</p><p>The Book of Revelation consists of 404 verses which contain over 800 allusions to the Old Testament alone! One reason the book appears so strange, is that most of us haven’t developed enough familiarity with the Old Testament.</p><p>The Bible consists of 66 books, penned by 40 authors over thousands of years, and yet we now discover that it is an integrated message: every detail, every word, every number, every place name is there by supernatural engineering.

Graham, President Reagan’s top science adviser and the chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack, will update the committee Thursday morning.</p><p>The radical Shiite regime has conducted successful tests to determine if its Shahab-3 ballistic missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, can be detonated by a remote-control device while still in high-altitude flight, Graham said in his report.</p><p>Graham warned in 2005 that Iran was not only covertly developing nuclear weapons, but was already testing ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy America’s technical infrastructure with the aim of neutralizing the world’s lone superpower.</p><p>Graham said then there was no other plausible explanation for such tests than preparation for the deployment of electromagnetic pulse weapons – even one of which could knock out America’s critical electrical and technological infrastructure, effectively sending the continental U.S. back to the 19th century with a recovery time of months or years.</p><p>Iran would have that capability – at least theoretically – as soon as it has one nuclear bomb ready to arm such a missile.</p><p>The stunning report was first published in Joseph Farah’s G2 Bulletin, the premium, online intelligence newsletter published by WND’s founder.</p><p>Iran surprised intelligence analysts by describing the mid-flight detonations of missiles fired from ships on the Caspian Sea as “successful” tests. Even primitive Scud missiles could be used for this purpose. And top U.S. intelligence officials reminded members of Congress that there is a glut of these missiles on the world market. They are currently being bought and sold for about $100,000 apiece.</p><p>Others agree with Graham’s sobering assessment.</p><p>“A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead ‘on target’ with a Scud, but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere,” wrote Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., in the Washington Post in 2005 after reading Graham’s report. “No need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city. Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters – al-Qaida is believed to own about 80 such vessels – and make sure to get it a few miles in the air.”</p><p>The Iranian missile tests were more sophisticated and capable of detonation at higher elevations – making them more dangerous.</p><p>Detonated at a height of 60 to 500 kilometers above the continental U.S., one nuclear warhead could cripple the country – knocking out electrical power and circuit boards and rendering the U.S. domestic communications impotent.</p><p>In 2005, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security chaired by Kyl, held a hearing on the electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, threat.</p><p>“An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the American homeland, said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing, is one of only a few ways that the United States could be defeated by its enemies – terrorist or otherwise,” wrote Kyl “And it is probably the easiest. A single Scud missile, carrying a single nuclear weapon, detonated at the appropriate altitude, would interact with the Earth’s atmosphere, producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light. Depending on the location and size of the blast, the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental United States, for months if not years.”</p><p>The purpose of an EMP attack, unlike a nuclear attack on land, is not to kill people, but “to kill electrons,” as Graham explained. He serves as chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack and was director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p><p>Graham told WND he could think of no other reason for Iran to be experimenting with mid-air detonation of missiles than for the planning of an EMP-style attack.</p><p>“EMP offers a bigger bang for the buck,” he said. He also suggested such an attack makes a U.S. nuclear response against a suspected enemy less likely than would the detonation of a nuclear bomb in a major U.S. city.</p><p>A 2004 report by the commission found “several potential adversaries have or can acquire the capability to attack the United States with a high-altitude nuclear weapons-generated electromagnetic pulse (EMP). A determined adversary can achieve an EMP attack capability without having a high level of sophistication.”</p><p>“EMP is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences,” the report said. “EMP will cover the wide geographic region within line of sight to the nuclear weapon. It has the capability to produce significant damage to critical infrastructures and thus to the very fabric of U.S. society, as well as to the ability of the United States and Western nations to project influence and military power.”</p><p>The major impact of EMP weapons is on electronics, “so pervasive in all aspects of our society and military, coupled through critical infrastructures,” explained the report.</p><p>“Their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation,” Lowell Wood, acting chairman of the commission, told members of Congress.</p><p>The commission report went so far as to suggest, in its opening sentence, that an EMP attack “might result in the defeat of our military forces.”</p><p>“Briefly, a single nuclear weapon exploded at high altitude above the United States will interact with the Earth’s atmosphere, ionosphere and magnetic field to produce an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation down to the Earth and additionally create electrical currents in the Earth,” said the report. “EMP effects are both direct and indirect.</p><p>The former are due to electrical systems, and the latter arise from the damage that ‘shocked’ – upset, damaged and destroyed – electronics controls then inflict on the systems in which they are embedded. The indirect effects can be even more severe than the direct effects.”</p><p>The EMP threat is not a new one considered by U.S. defense planners. The Soviet Union had experimented with the idea as a kind of super-weapon against the U.S.</p><p>“What is different now is that some potential sources of EMP threats are difficult to deter – they can be terrorist groups that have no state identity, have only one or a few weapons and are motivated to attack the U.S. without regard for their own safety,” explains the commission report. “Rogue states, such as North Korea and Iran, may also be developing the capability to pose an EMP threat to the United States and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter.”</p><p>Graham describes the potential “cascading effect” of an EMP attack. If electrical power is knocked out and circuit boards fried, telecommunications are disrupted, energy deliveries are impeded, the financial system breaks down, food, water and gasoline become scarce.</p><p>As Kyl put it: “Few if any people would die right away. But the loss of power would have a cascading effect on all aspects of U.S. society. Communication would be largely impossible. Lack of refrigeration would leave food rotting in warehouses, exacerbated by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still working simply ran out of gas (which is pumped with electricity). The inability to sanitize and distribute water would quickly threaten public health, not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires, which would rage unchecked. And as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters, such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order.”</p><p>“American society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own Achilles’ heel of vulnerability, ironically much greater than those of other, less developed nations,” the senator wrote.</p><p>“When deprived of power, we are in many ways helpless, as the New York City blackout made clear. In that case, power was restored quickly because adjacent areas could provide help.</p><p>But a large-scale burnout caused by a broad EMP attack would create a much more difficult situation. Not only would there be nobody nearby to help, it could take years to replace destroyed equipment.”</p><p>The commission said hardening key infrastructure systems and procuring vital backup equipment such as transformers is both feasible and – compared with the threat – relatively inexpensive.</p><p>“But it will take leadership by the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, and other federal agencies, along with support from Congress, all of which have yet to materialize,” wrote Kyl, so far the only elected official blowing the whistle this alarming development.</p><p>Kyl concluded in his report: “The Sept. 11 commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of ‘imagination.’ No one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on Sept. 11. Today few Americans can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring our society to its knees by destroying everything we rely on that runs on electricity. But this time we’ve been warned, and we’d better be prepared to respond.”</p>	#B56FEA	\N	\N	[]	t

Historically it is the saddest day in our calendar. The Jewish people mark this day as a day of mourning and fasting. This is not a biblical holiday but a Rabbinically instituted one. BAD things have happened to the Jewish people on this date!!</p><p>The observance of Tisha B’Av began sometime after the destruction of the 1st Temple. Zechariah records in 4:3–5 that the people wept, mourned &amp; fasted on the 9th of Av. Many bad things have happened on this exact day. On the 9th of Av, Moses broke the first tablets of Law when he came down from Sinai to find the people worshiping the golden calf. When the spies returned back from the Land flowing with Milk and Honey and stated that the land was filled with giants and could not be conquered, the people cried out to go back to Egypt!! Because they choose to believe the spies and not God, God decreed that they would never enter the Promised Land, only their children would enter!!</p><p>Some other bad things recorded on this date are:</p><p>The 1st &amp; 2nd Temples were both destroyed on the 9th of AV!</p><p>The Jews were expelled from England on the 9th of Av.</p><p>On March 31st, 1492 the Jews were given 4 months to put their affairs in order and leave Spain. The date which no Jew was allowed to be in Spain…yes the 9th of Av. This is the day Columbus set sail with a boat load of Jewish people being expelled from Spain.</p><p>Holocaust historians conclude, Germany declared war on Russia 1914…..yes on the 9th of Av.</p><p>Hitler presented his plan to the Nazi Party on the “Final Solution” to the Jewish problem, July 31, 1940 — Tisha B’Av</p><p>On a personal note, in July of 2001, I had a widow maker heart attack…it was on the 9th of AV. What the enemy meant for bad, God turned to good!</p><p>On August 17, 2005…..8,500 Jewish settlers in 21 settlements from Gush Katif (in Gaza) were removed from their homes, yes on the 9th of Av</p><p>Tish B’Av has no Messianic or prophetic significance…but the WORD speaks of ALL fast days being turned into days of joy, gladness and cheer, when our Messiah returns to establish HIS reign on earth. We as believers must be mindful of the gravity of this day as our people are remembering and fasting! If we are to Fast, let us enter into a true fast as described in Isaiah 58: 6–9</p><p><em>Is</em> this not the fast that I have chosen:</p><p>To loose the bonds of wickedness,</p><p>To undo the heavy burdens,</p><p>To let the oppressed go free,</p><p>And that you break every yoke?</p><p><em>Is it</em> not to share your bread with the hungry,</p><p>And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out;</p><p>When you see the naked, that you cover him,</p><p>And not hide yourself from your own flesh?</p><p>Then your light shall break forth like the morning, Your healing shall spring forth speedily, And your righteousness shall go before you; The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; You shall cry, and He will say, ‘Here I <em>am.</em>’</p><p>We must seek to bring the Good news to them so their mourning can turn from sadness into joy!</p><p><br></p>	#FF4600	\N	\N	\N	t

Michael Hile</h4><p>We know from the Scriptures that the first generation began with Adam and Eve. Noah was the tenth generation. Which generation do we represent? And, which generation of people was Messiah talking about that would see His return when He said: “…This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled” (Mt 24:34)? The answer to this elusive, 2000-year-old question may be closer than we think, if the many prophecies we see converging on the horizon continue their march towards fulfillment in the 21st century.</p><h3>The Generation of His Coming</h3><p>Perhaps the most intriguing and controversial prophetic Scripture passage found in the Bible is contained in the Olivet Discourse. This dynamic “end times” message by Yeshua, contained in Matthew 24 and 25, Mark 13, and Luke 21, describes major events that will impact the Jewish people just before the Lord returns to set up His Kingdom.</p><p>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory…Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. -Matthew 24:30-36</p><p>This remarkable prophecy of future events, given by Yeshua on Mount Olivet after leaving the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, was in response to three questions from His disciples: “When shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world” (Mt 24:3)? The generation that will be living on the earth when Messiah returns is alluded to in this discourse. The belief that the generation Yeshua was talking about was the generation that passed away in 70 A.D. does not fit within the context of a literal return of Messiah back to earth, as described in the Scriptures preceding and following the parable of the fig tree. Two questions one might raise about this unique generation and other generations described in the Bible are: 1) How long is a generation? and 2) Which generation was Messiah talking about?</p><h3>The Generation Question</h3><p>One of the most perplexing and sought-after answers among students of Bible prophecy is the length of a generation. There is much disagreement among both secular and religious writers concerning the length of a generation. Is the length of a generation 40 years? When Israel became a nation in 1948, some believed that Israel’s birth date marked the beginning of the generation that would see all the events leading up to the Second Coming of Messiah.</p><p>This theory was based upon the generation alluded to in the parable of the fig tree, in which the fig tree was symbolic of the nation Israel. (For a more detailed study of the fig tree in Biblical history, see Judg 9:8-15; Jer 24:1-10; Lk 13:6-9; Mt 21:17-21; Mk 11:11-14, 20-21; Lk 19:41-44; Rom 11:1,2,25-27; Isa 66:8; Mt 24:32-51; Mk 13:28-37; Lk 21:29-36; and Rev 6:13.)</p><p>When 40 years passed in 1988 without fulfillment of any of the events surrounding the Second Coming of Messiah, the 40-year generation theory fell into disrepute. Either 1948 was not the starting date for the generation described in the fig tree parable, or a generation must be longer than 40 years, according to the theory. Additional arguments put forth claimed that 1967, the year Jerusalem was captured, or some other future date could be the birth of the generation that would see the return of Messiah.</p><p>Some proponents of the “end times” generation theory questioned whether 40 years was actually the length of a generation today. Is there any evidence to suggest that the length of a generation is longer than 40 years? A few sources hold that a generation is now 20 to 30 years in length (but this better represents a generation “gap”). Other opinions range from 40 to 100 years. Just how long is a generation today? Is there an answer to the generation question?</p><h3>The Longevity of Mankind</h3><p>A generation, as described in the Bible, begins at conception and ends at death (Gen 17:6-9; Ps 22:30; Jer 1:4,5; Act 13:36; Josh 24:29-31). The length of a generation is not an arbitrary period of time that occurs within the life span of an individual or group of people. Joshua’s age at the time of death, 110 years (including 9 months gestation), was the length of the generation he represented. Some of his generation died before him and some after him. Consequently, the average life span of a group of people living at about the same time constitutes the length of that generation.</p><p>The length of a generation has not always been constant since the days of Adam and Eve. Before the Biblical flood, the average life span of man was over 900 years. Today, if a person lives to be a hundred years old, it is a special occasion in which the person is accorded celebrity status. In order to understand how long a generation is today, it will be helpful to know what the length of a generation was before the Flood and what happened to the life span of man immediately following the Flood. Has man’s life span increased, decreased or stayed the same down through the centuries?</p><p><br></p><h3>[This chart]1 shows that the average length of a generation was about 930 years for those living before the Flood but decreased to around 120 years by the time Moses crossed the Red Sea and ended his 40-year sojourn in the wilderness of Sinai. Since there are not very many 120-year-old individuals walking around today, it is apparent that the average life span is no longer 120 years. Eli, a High Priest and Judge of Israel whose life bridged the 13th and 12th centuries B.C., died at the age of 98 years (1 Sam 4:15). According to the Scriptures, he was considered to be a “very old” person at the time of his death (1 Sam 2:22).The Wilderness Generation</h3><p>Perhaps the most widely held belief for the length of a generation is forty years. A 40-year period was required for the disobedient generation of Moses’ day to die off in the wilderness. Those who hold to the forty-year generation concept do not take into account the total age of those who had sinned against the Lord. The curse was to be against the men who had reached twenty years of age (Num 32:11-13, Ps 95:8-11, Heb 3:7-11). After the 40-year judgment period was completed, there were no men left older than 60 years of age except Joshua and Caleb.</p><p>Although Joshua was not a descendant of Moses or Aaron, he represented the succeeding generation that was to enter the “Promised Land.” Joshua and Caleb were the only two males permitted to live after the Lord cursed the rebellious generation that would not return and retake their land in Canaan. So forty years could not have been the length of that generation, but it was the time God allotted for that generation to die off. Most of the recorded life spans during this time were well over 40 years. Aaron was 123, Moses 120, Joshua 110, and Caleb was over 85 when their generations died off.</p><h3>A View from the Psalmist</h3><p>Disregarding untimely or unnatural deaths due to epidemics, famine, and war, there is evidence in the Scriptures and in recent history to support a 70 to 80 year life span for the past 3000 years. The evidence for a 70 to 80 year life span was present during the 10th century B.C., during the reign of King David (c.1010-970). As David approached the end of his life, he was considered to be an old man by those living at that time. The Scriptures reveal that David served his generation and was seventy years old when he died (1 Chr 23:1; 2 Sam 5:4; 1 Kgs 2:10; Act 13:36). Perhaps the most significant declaration in the Bible for the life span of man is given in Psalm 90. The Psalmist states that the life span of man is seventy years, with eighty years being the upper range of normal life expectancy.</p><p>For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: We spend our years as a tale that is told. The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away. -Psalm 90:9,10</p><p>If 70 to 80 years still represents the length of a generation, as described in Psalm 90:9,10, one would expect the life span of those living today to be close to that figure. The life expectancy of those living in the United States in 1850 was less than 40 years but increased to 47 years by 1900 and then mushroomed to 77 years (1999) by the end of the 20th century. According to the 2002 World Almanac and Book of Facts, the average life expectancy in the United States is 77 years (74 years for males and 80 years for females). For Israel it is 79 years (77 years for males and 81 years for females). The average life expectancy at birth for Israel is projected to be 82 in the year 2025.</p><h3>Which Generation was Messiah Talking About?</h3><p>With Israel back in their land after almost 2000 years of dispersion (the Diaspora) and other end time prophecies coming into focus, the Jewish people now living in Israel could very well be the generation Messiah was talking about. Luke’s version of the fig tree parable, which mentions the fig tree (Israel) and all the trees (nations of the world-see Judg 9:8-20; Dan 4:26; Ps 2:1-12; Mt 25:31,32), states:</p><p>And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I say unto you. This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. -Luke 21:29-33</p><p>If the length of David’s generation, Messiah’s generation, and the average life span of those living today in Israel is between 70 and 80 years (a 3000-year span), it would be reasonable to conclude that the generation Messiah was talking about in the parable of the fig tree will also be 70 to 80 years in length. If the fig tree in this parable represents the nation of Israel, as many prophetic scholars believe, and the generation that is described has a life span of 70 to 80 years, then recent events such as the rebirth of Israel as a nation (Isa 66:8), the Jerusalem controversy in the “end times” (Zech 12:1-3), preparations for rebuilding the Jewish Temple (Rev 11:1,2), and the ongoing negotiations for a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians (Dan 9:27) are strong indicators that the generation Messiah was talking about has already been born, and the return of Yeshua Messiah to establish His reign for a thousand years is close at hand.</p><h3>The Most Significant End Time Prophecy</h3><p>The “end time” events described in the Olivet Discourse and the book of Revelation could not take place without Israel back in their land. Israel’s return to the land of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the 20th century is the most important event that signals the soon return of Yeshua Messiah.</p><p>…I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime…And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. -II Samuel 7:10-16</p><p>Israel’s rebirth as a nation has also served as a catalyst for other “end time” prophecies that are beginning to converge on the world scene (Dan 2:42-22; Ezek 38-39). The Apostle Paul told us “…that in the last days perilous times shall come” (2 Tim 3:1-7). Yeshua said there would be a time of worldwide conflict and wars that would be “the beginning of sorrows” (Mt 24:8). Messiah said, “except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved…” (Mk 13:20).</p><p>The ability of man to destroy all flesh on the earth became a real possibility for the first time in the history of the world during the second half of the 20th century with the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The 21st century will witness an unprecedented increase in surveillance and eavesdropping as the global government “big brother” system wraps its tentacles around every aspect of human life, while promising “peace and security” to those who relinquish their freedoms (Rev 13:16-18; 1Thess 5: 3).</p><p>Believers who take the Bible seriously should be actively watching the prophetic shadows that are appearing in today’s headlines. And as we entertain the possibility that we may be the generation Yeshua was talking about in the fig tree parable nearly 2000 years ago, we are admonished by the Scriptures to watch and be prepared (Mt 24: 37-51).</p><p>As stated clearly by Yeshua in Matthew and Mark, no man knows the day or the hour of his coming, but the Father only. The same Yeshua, however, was very angry with the Pharisees and Scribes for not discerning “the signs of the times” (Mt 16:3) and not knowing the “time of their visitation” (Lk 19:44).</p><p>One day there will be a generation of believers that will escape the grip of death and be ushered into Heaven, the “final frontier” for believers (1 Thess 4:13-5:11). The generation that is “left behind” will face the ruthless tyranny of a global dictatorship (Rev 13:11-18). The world stage is now being set for the closing act of this dispensation, and the climax of world history (Messiah’s return) is drawing near. As God’s children, we may very well be the generation that is chosen to “escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man” (Lk 21:34-36). That possibility is certainly worth pondering!</p>	#031AF7	\N	\N	\N	t

Your denial of God does not lessen His existence, nor does your belief prove His existence. If your opinion is that you don’t believe in God, is it because you’ve decided that if God really existed, He would not allow such terrible things to happen? Or is it because of what you have personally experienced or been told or grown up with?</p><p>In my opinion, if you do not include the evidences of the Bible, then science is the strongest proof of God’s existence. The reason that I say this is that you can’t use the Bible to prove God if you don’t yet believe in God, since the Bible was written by God. That’s like defining a word by using the word you are trying to define to define itself.</p><p>So let’s begin by looking at today’s scientific evidence that God is real. Then we’ll look at some proofs that come from the Bible itself.</p><p>If you believe evolution is true and God did not create all things, then let’s get real basic here and tell me…</p><ul><li>Where did gravity come from?</li><li>Where did the space for the universe come from?</li><li>Where did matter come from?</li><li>Where did the energy come from for evolution to even begin?</li><li>How did so many complicated systems originally become organized beyond even man’s present day abilities?</li></ul><p>If evolution were true, it would break the first law of thermodynamics, which is that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. Man, an intelligent being, with his scientific knowledge, and under the best of laboratory conditions, has tried, but has been unable, as yet, to produce life from non-life. Is it thinkable then, that somewhere along the way, non-intelligent matter, by itself, and without any help from any intellect, once brought forth life from non-life? Is this really a plausible explanation for the beginning of life?</p><p>Let’s take a very simplified experiment and see how realistic it is. If I took 50 pennies and dropped them on the ground, could I convince you that they would land in five perfectly parallel rows of ten pennies each? Not a chance. But some people still believe that highly complex organisms somehow just fell into place…</p><p>Let’s take a very simplified experiment and see how realistic it is. If I took 50 pennies and dropped them on the ground, could I convince you that they would land in five perfectly parallel rows of ten pennies each? Not a chance. But some people still believe that highly complex organisms somehow just fell into place…</p><p>Today let’s briefly look at our brain as scientific evidence of God.</p><p>Your brain can analyze, reason, recall, calculate, and communicate. No computer comes close. Your brain can effortlessly and instantaneously send messages to our tongue, mouth and lips, allowing you to verbalize a word that someone else can comprehend. Your brain can open and close your fist. Your brain does not have to physically touch your hand to make it move. Instead, it sends an impulse to your hand and voilà, the clench of your fist, the snap of your fingers or the creation of art. The options and features are only limited by the creativity of your… brain. Speaking of which, your hand alone has more standard features than a brand new Mercedes!</p><p>Fortunately, while you sleep, your brain does not shut down. Instead it continues to work and keeps your body fully functioning while you recharge. Speaking of which, do you know another machine that recharges itself…on its own? I think you get the point.</p><p>With the coming of computers, we have seen an explosion of knowledge about the brain and how it does all of the things it does. The greater emphasis has been on how our senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and feeling are handled by the brain.</p><p>We can recognize a friend instantly; full face, in profile, or even by the back of his head. We can distinguish hundreds of colors and possibly as many as 10,000 smells. We can feel a feather as it brushes our skin, hear the faint rustle of a leaf It all seems so effortless: we open our eyes or ears and let the world stream in. Yet anything we see, hear, feel, smell, or taste requires billions of nerve cells to flash urgent messages along linked pathways and feedback loops in our brains, performing intricate calculations that scientists have only begun to decipher.</p><p>When you watch a movie at the theater, for example, there are 24 separate pictures being put onto the screen every second. If the subject on the film is moving, your brain interprets the object as a moving object. If the object is sitting still, you still see it. It does not have to be moving for you to be able to see it and identify it.</p><p>A frog, on the other hand, cannot see an object unless it is moving. Place a fly that is immobile in front of a starving frog and it will ignore it. Unless the fly is moving, the frog cannot tell that it is there. If the fly starts to move, then the frog will eat it.</p><p>Basically, the retina of the frog detects movement while our retina does not–we use our brain to detect motion. But how about colors?</p><p>It may sound like a really simple question for us to ask, “how do we see colors of light. All of us probably have some awareness of the fact that our eyes have cones that we use to receive color information. What we may not realize is that light itself actually has no color! Light is a bundle of energy pulsating at a particular frequency, but has no color at all. The sensation of color is generated in the mind–not in the physical world.</p><p>The answer to the color question is in the brain. When a particular frequency is received in the sight part of the brain, a mental image is generated that we call color. The brain does this, not the light. The color spectrum is merely symbolic of the various wavelengths that we sense. Our brain takes the response that comes from the eyes and forms a color image for us.</p><p>Isn’t it incredible to realize that our eyes do not really see, but that our brain is the real organ of vision?</p><p>I think we all know that even today’s most advanced super computers are primitive compared to our brains. Yet we create these computers very methodically. Each successive discovery built upon a previous one. So even with all of our intelligence and success to build on we still can’t even understand let alone reproduce our brains. And we have the advantage of being able to examine and dissect as many brains as we want. In other words we get to look at a successful working brain and we still can’t reproduce it.</p><p>So if you want to say that there is no God or no intelligent creator then let me ask you these questions…</p><p>Can you name just one building in the world that didn’t have a maker?</p><p>Can you name just one painting in the world that didn’t have a painter?</p><p>Can you name just one truck in the world that didn’t have a designer?</p><p>All of this was said to make the point that there is a master creator. We call Him God.</p><p>This then leads to the fair question: “Why can’t I see God?” Just because you</p><p>can’t see Him doesn’t negate His existence. You can’t see radio or television waves, but they are passing right in front of your eyes as you are reading this. Nor can you see the wind, but you know it exists too. Has anyone ever seen a man’s mind? Now I didn’t say his brain, I said his mind. Can you prove through any of your five senses that man has a mind? To rule out God on this ground would be to rule out the fact that man has a mind. In the same way, it is not possible to prove a mother’s love by using a slide-rule or a computer, but the fact that such things cannot be proven in this way does not show that they are not true.</p><p>Let’s say that you are a certified genius with the highest IQ ever. Putting that in perspective, let’s say that this circle represents ALL the knowledge in the universe. Since you are so intelligent we will say that you know an incredible 1% of all knowledge! Is it possible that within the other 99% of knowledge you still don’t have… lies the proof that God does exist?</p><p>Let’s move on now to what God wrote down in His book, which we call the Bible. Actually much of the Bible is history written before it occurs which is why it is called His Story, since He exists outside of time and sees what we think of as the future, present, and past all at once. God does not work on a timeline. He came before time and created it along with everything else. How do I know that? Because the Bible says so.</p><p>2 Timothy 1:9 states, “The Grace of God that we now experience was put into effect before the beginning of time”</p><p>Titus 1:2 states, “The hope that we have in Yeshua the Messiah was given to us before the beginning of time.”</p><p>My hope is that you too will believe in God and believe that only He could have written the Bible. I say this because the Bible tells us things that were written down LONG before we “discovered” them. Here are just a few examples:</p><p>There was a time when men actually believed that the world was flat and held up by three very big elephants. But do you remember Christopher Columbus? He was very well versed in the Scriptures. He knew the Earth was round because of what was written in Isaiah 40:21, 22. “Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?</p><p>He sits enthroned upon the circle of the earth…” In Hebrew the word for circle actually means sphere. So Chris wasn’t so brave after all…</p><p>How about the discovery that the Earth is suspended in space? (Job 26:7) “He spreads out the north over the empty space, He suspends the earth upon nothing.” This was only discovered in the last few centuries, yet written about thousands of years ago in our Scriptures.</p><p>So was there really a flood? Well, there ARE over 500 flood legends from cultures all over the world and there ARE all of those seashells imbedded in the top 3000 feet of rock on Mount Everest.</p><p>Speaking of such discoveries, in the sixteenth century men discovered that air has weight. But, the oldest book in our Scriptures tells us this in Job 28:24,25</p><p>“For He looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heavens, to establish a weight for the wind…”</p><p>How did Moses, who wrote the Torah (the first 5 books of the Bible), know about germs… did he have a microscope hidden on his camel?</p><p>Unlike today, up until 1845 as many as 30 percent of women who gave birth in hospitals died. Back then doctors moved from patient to patient without washing their hands. But God knew about the germs that were invisible to men, and gave us instructions in the third book of our Bible that when dealing with the sick, we need to wash our hands specifically in running water. Leviticus 15:13 …and bathe his body in running water; then he shall be clean.</p><p>Ok, so now let’s move on now to what the Bible says will happen in our day and time and see how accurate it is.</p><p>I should warn you that part of what follows is scary because it accurately depicts the global events making headlines today.</p><p>Remember that in the Bible God can and does tell us what will happen before it happens. This is called prophecy and nearly 1/3 of everything written in the Bible is prophecy. Now to me this is one of the strongest proofs that both God and the Bible are real. Nobody can accurately predict the future 100% of the time, but God not only does this but He has it written down ahead of time so it can be verified by all the skeptics of this world. Here are just a few past examples:</p><p>Did you know that God told Abraham ahead of time that the Jews would be</p><p>enslaved in Egypt for 400 years, and they were? (Genesis 15:13) “Then the L-RD said to him, ‘Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.’”</p><p>Isaiah predicted the actual name of the king who 120 years after his prophecy would order Jerusalem to be rebuilt. Again Isaiah the prophet calls him by name before he was even born!</p><p>Isaiah 44:28 … “who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please;’ he will say of Jerusalem, ‘Let it be re-built,’ and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.”</p><p>To further show the accuracy of biblical prophecy Isaiah prophesied about 100 years before the Babylonian captivity, that is before the Jews were even taken captive the first time, God told the Jewish prophet Isaiah about the second time He would sovereignly bring us back into our own land. In Isaiah 11:11, it says, “In that day the Lord will bring back a remnant of His people for the second time, returning them to the land of Israel…” And of course we know this happened May 14, 1948 when the country of Israel was reborn.</p><p>The exact dates of May 14, 1948 when the sate of Israel was reborn as a nation and June, 6, 1967 when she regained Jerusalem are prophesied exactly to the day in the book of Ezekiel. You can read a shortened explanation of this in my book which is available for free online at http://prophecyrevealed.com/friendbook.htm and it is on page 12.</p><p>So what is God saying about what is going on now-a-days. Well before I get accused of being an end of days or doomsday nut, let me tell you that the Bible is very clear about what will be happening in the time period known as the end of days. I am not saying that the earth is going to end, the end of days is the time period before the end of the earth as we know it. It is presently a mess! You see God is like our parents who gave us rules to follow and if we disobeyed there were consequences. Well, God gave us rules to follow and since we have chosen to disobey, we are paying the consequences in wars, famines, diseases, and so on, just as God warned us would happen. Everyone is doing their own thing and… well you can see how well that’s working out.</p><p>Now remember that this is not a surprise to God, He already knows what will be happening today and tomorrow and in the future and He wrote about it in His Bible. Here is just one example of our present day headlines and the Biblical prophecies that foretell of them:</p><p>I would like to start with Iran as it is not only so prominent in the news but it is one of the countries that God says would come against Israel in the end of days.</p><p>Ezekiel 37 foretells again of Israel being re-gathered in the end of days. Ezekiel 38 and 39 discuss a coalition of nations including Russia, Iran (called Persia in the Bible as this is the original name of Iran), Turkey, Libya, Sudan and certain central Asian nations unleashing an all out attack against Israel. Will the USA just stand idly by or will we be unable to respond? If the Islamic terrorists have their way we will be unable to respond. And I don’t say that lightly, nor should you just shluff it off as a non-possibility.</p><p>Iran knows that in order to annihilate Israel it will also have to deal with the USA. It is obvious from present day intelligence that Iran is not only planning on doing so but is already starting. Let’s look at just one of their weapons systems that they are developing to knock us out. If you have ever heard of an EMP weapon (ElectroMagnetic Pulse) it is probably one of the easiest ways to knock out the electricity in virtually the entire USA with just one small nuclear bomb that already exists. And they don’t even need to bring it into the country to use it or even shoot it at us. And when I say knock out the electricity I mean for many months, even for years. Please understand this means the electricity not just in our homes, factories, and workplaces, but also in our cars in trucks and trains too. We are not talking about just telephones, TV’s radio, and all other forms of communications that require electricity, but every major system like water and sewer, crop production, etc. that we are totally dependent on. We would instantly be brought to our knees, brought back to the 19th century, and would be unable to fight back since all of our modern day weaponry depends on electricity and satellite communications. Our days as a super power would be over instantly and permanently.</p><p>So how does this bomb work and how is the EMP bomb deployed? Let’s read an excerpt from WorldNetDaily.com</p><p>WASHINGTON — Iran is not only covertly developing nuclear weapons, it is already testing ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy America’s technical infrastructure, effectively neutralizing the world’s lone superpower, say U.S. intelligence sources, top scientists and western missile industry experts.</p><p>Scientists, including President Reagan’s top science adviser, William R. Graham, say there is no other explanation for such tests than preparation for the deployment of electromagnetic pulse weapons – even one of which could knock out America’s critical electrical and technological infrastructure, effectively sending the continental U.S. back to the 19th century with a recovery time of months or years.</p><p>Iran has surprised intelligence analysts by describing the mid-flight detonations of missiles fired from ships on the Caspian Sea as “successful” tests. Even primitive Scud missiles could be used for this purpose. And top U.S. intelligence officials reminded members of Congress that there is a glut of these missiles on the world market. They are currently being bought and sold for about $100,000 apiece. The fact is that both Iran and North Korea have recently fired missles that “suddenly exploded” at exactly 180 miles above the earth. Our media reported these as failures but our military knows better!</p><p>“A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead ‘on target’ with a Scud, but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere,” wrote Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., in the Washington Post a week ago. “No need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city. Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters – al-Qaida is believed to own about 80 such vessels – and make sure to get it a few miles in the air.”</p><p>The Iranian missile tests were more sophisticated and capable of detonation at higher elevations – making them more dangerous.</p><p>Detonated at a height of 60 to 500 kilometers above the continental U.S., one nuclear warhead could cripple the country – knocking out electrical power and circuit boards and rendering the U.S. domestic communications impotent.</p><p>Jerome Corsi, author of “Atomic Iran,” told WorldNetDaily the new findings about Iran’s electromagnetic pulse experiments significantly raise the stakes of the mullah regime’s bid to become a nuclear power</p><p>“Up until now, I believed the nuclear threat to the U.S. from Iran was limited to the ability of terrorists to penetrate the borders or port security to deliver a device to a major city,” he said. “While that threat should continue to be a grave concern for every American, these tests by Iran demonstrate just how devious the fanatical mullahs in Tehran are. We are facing a clever and unscrupulous adversary in Iran that could bring America to its knees.”</p><p>Last month, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, held a hearing on the electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, threat.</p><p>“An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the American homeland, said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing, is one of only a few ways that the United States could be defeated by its enemies – terrorist or otherwise,” “And it is probably the easiest. A single Scud missile, carrying a single nuclear weapon, detonated at the appropriate altitude, would interact with the Earth’s atmosphere, producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light. Depending on the location and size of the blast, the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental United States, for months if not years.”</p><p>The purpose of an EMP attack, unlike a nuclear attack on land, is not to kill people, but “to kill electrons,” as Graham explained. He serves as chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack and was director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and science adviser to the president during the Reagan administration.</p><p>Graham told WorldNetDaily he could think of no other reason for Iran to be experimenting with mid-air detonation of missiles than for the planning of an EMP-style attack.</p><p>“EMP offers a bigger bang for the buck,” he said. He also suggested such an attack makes a U.S. nuclear response against a suspected enemy less likely than would the detonation of a nuclear bomb in a major U.S. city.</p><p>A 2004 report by the commission found “several potential adversaries have or can acquire the capability to attack the United States with a high-altitude nuclear weapons-generated electromagnetic pulse (EMP). A determined adversary can achieve an EMP attack capability without having a high level of sophistication.”</p><p>“Their effects on systems and infrastructures dependent on electricity and electronics could be sufficiently ruinous as to qualify as catastrophic to the nation,” Lowell Wood, acting chairman of the commission, told members of Congress.</p><p>“Few if any people would die right away. But the loss of power would have a cascading effect on all aspects of U.S. society. Communication would be largely impossible. Lack of refrigeration would leave food rotting in warehouses, exacerbated by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still working simply ran out of gas (which is pumped with electricity). The inability to sanitize and distribute water would quickly threaten public health, not to mention the safety of anyone in the path of the inevitable fires, which would rage unchecked. And as we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters, such circumstances often result in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order.”</p><p>“American society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own Achilles’ heel of vulnerability, ironically much greater than those of other, less developed nations,” the senator wrote. “When deprived of power, we are in many ways helpless, as the New York City blackout made clear. In that case, power was restored quickly because adjacent areas could provide help. But a large-scale burnout caused by a broad EMP attack would create a much more difficult situation. Not only would there be nobody nearby to help, it could take years to replace destroyed equipment.”</p><p>The report concluded: “The Sept. 11 commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of ‘imagination.’ No one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on Sept. 11. Today few Americans can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring our society to its knees by destroying everything we rely on that runs on electricity. But this time we’ve been warned, and we’d better be prepared to respond.</p><p>So how can you and I personally prepare for these times we are entering into?</p><p>The first and most important thing we need to do is get right with God. Why? Because He promises to save us and there is no one else that can. It’s as simple as that. But there is a problem. God does not accept everyone into the safety and security of His Kingdom. Since He is God He is like our parents. He gets to set the rules. And the rule is nobody gets saved and ultimately into Heaven unless He meets God’s standards.</p><p>Now if you are thinking well that leaves me out, I know what kind of a person I’ve been and I have rejected God and His teachings… Or if you are thinking well that’s good, I know God will accept me as I have been very good and have helped a lot of people over the years so God will save me… then either way you are wrong according to what God says. No matter how much good or bad you have done it doesn’t get you a free pass.</p><p>You see, our God, who is holy, tells us some very direct things about ourselves, and our place in eternity.</p><p>In Proverbs 14:12, He puts us in our place. “There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.”</p><p>Then in Isaiah 64:6, “All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.”</p><p>And in Isaiah 59:1,2, “Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor His ear too dull to hear. But your iniquities (sins) have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.”</p><p>God is telling YOU directly that you can’t obtain salvation for your soul by working for it or being good or being “better” than others.</p><p>In fact God gave us the 10 commandments as a simple outline to follow so that we would know if and when we sinned. So before you decide you are good enough for God to accept, why not see how you have faired during your life so far with regards to living within God’s standards of conduct…</p><p>Have you ever told a lie for any reason (including fibs and “white” lies)?</p><p>Have you ever stolen anything… regardless of its value… even years ago?</p><p>Have you ever coveted what someone else has?</p><p>Have you ever used the Lord’s name in vain (used God’s name when cursing)?</p><p>Have you ever had sex outside of marriage?</p><p>So… How many of just these 5 commandments have you broken? Then by God’s standards will you be innocent or guilty when He judges you?</p><p><strong>Does this concern you?</strong></p><p>Now again, let me ask you a question. Are you already justifying in your mind that you are better than most people, or that you are only human, or that you only stole a little thing and that’s when you were little, or everyone else is like me so I guess nobody’s getting saved or admitted to heaven???</p><p>Maybe you gave back what you stole and you said you were sorry and even asked God to forgive you. Or you told that “white” lie because you didn’t want to hurt the persons feelings or to “help them out.”</p><p>So, when you get to stand before God, like every single person in the world will do someday, will you be hoping that He will be a “good” judge and listen to your reasons and that He’ll let you off? Let’s go into a courtroom and try that one.</p><p>“Well, you see judge I was really hungry, and I needed to feed my kids. I am really sorry, and you know that I DID pay the guy back…And besides that was a long time ago and I don’t steal anymore…”</p><p>Now, if the judge is a “good” judge, will he let you go? Or will he still be required to find you guilty according to the law? Will it matter that you said you are sorry, or will the law still require you to pay the fine?</p><p>Now wouldn’t it be nice if there was some way out of this? Well, if the judge is lenient he may tell you that, if you can come up with $500,000 today he will let you go, otherwise you must go to jail.</p><p>What if just at that moment, as the shackles are being put on you, an unknown person comes running into the courtroom and pays your fine. Would you be overjoyed, or would you stop him?</p><p>Would you say “I don’t know you or believe in you and I would rather go to prison and never see my family again than accept your free gift?” Of course not. You would be eternally grateful.</p><p>This is exactly what Yeshua, God’s Son did for you! He offers you a free pardon and all you have to do is accept His free gift.</p><p><strong>BUT…</strong></p><p>In order for Him to pay the fine for all of the commandments you broke, you must turn to Him BEFORE you die (before you get to court) and acknowledge from your heart:</p><p>“Lord, I have broken Your commandments, and I am sorry. Please accept my apology. I will try my best to stop sinning, and I ask You to forgive me and wipe the slate clean. I accept the fact that You already sent Your Son into the courtroom for those whose names are written in Your Book of Life and their fines are paid in full. I thank You that You have allowed me a way to avoid going to prison (hell), and are assuring me that by turning to You and accepting Your Son Yeshua as my Messiah (saviour), my fine is paid and my name is now written in the Book of Life, forever. Thank You!”</p><p>God decided and wrote down in the Bible a long time ago that there is only one way to be accepted by Him into heaven and to be saved from the coming destruction upon the earth. Here are His exact words to you. Take these personally for that is how they are intended.</p><p>“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.”</p><p>Yeshua, (the name of God’s Son which by the way means salvation or God saves) said this in the Bible so there would be no mistake about how to be saved in the day of destruction…</p><p>He said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father (God) except through me.</p><p>So we must first accept God’s plan and through the pardon offered by his Son we are assured safety and ultimate salvation for eternity.</p><p>Don’t let another minute go by without asking for your pardon. It is a free gift!</p><p>Read my short book for free. <a href="https://www.ihaveafriendwhoisjewish.com/" target="_blank">Click Here to read it now.</a></p>	#031AF7	\N	\N	[]	t

The Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, The Book of Mormon, and other religious works all claim to be divinely inspired. The Bible claims to be the only book that is divinely inspired and that all other claims of inspiration from other works should be ruled out. Does the Bible confirm its exclusive claim to be the Word of God? The totality of evidences presents a strong case for the divine inspiration of the Bible.</p><p>The strongest argument for the divine inspiration of the Bible is the testimony of Jesus. Jesus claimed to be the divine Son of God and confirmed His claims through His sinless, miraculous life and resurrection. The events of His life have been recorded in the four Gospels, which have proven to be historically accurate and written by first century eyewitnesses.{1} Since Jesus is God incarnate, whatever He taught is true, and anything opposed to His teaching is false.</p><p>Jesus directly affirmed the authority of the Old Testament and indirectly affirmed the New Testament. In Luke 11:51, Jesus identified the prophets and the canon of the Old Testament. He names Abel as the first prophet from Genesis, and Zechariah the last prophet mentioned in 2 Chronicles, the last book in the Jewish Old Testament (which contains the same books we have today although placed in a different order). In Mark 7:8-9, Jesus refers to the Old Testament as the commands of God. In Matthew 5:17, Jesus states that the Law and the Prophets referring to the Old Testament is authoritative and imperishable. Throughout His ministry, Jesus made clear His teachings, corrections, and actions were consistent with the Old Testament. He also judged others teachings and traditions by the Old Testament. He thus demonstrated His affirmation of the Old Testament to be the Word of God.</p><p>Jesus even specifically affirmed as historical several disputed stories of the Old Testament. He affirms as true the accounts of Adam and Eve (Matthew 19:4-5), Noah and the flood (Matthew 24:39), Jonah and the whale (Matthew 12:40), Sodom and Gomorrah (Matthew 10:15), and more.</p><p>Jesus confirmed the Old Testament and promised that the Holy Spirit would inspire the apostles in the continuation of His teaching and in the writing of what would become the New Testament (John 14:25-26 and John 16:12-13). The apostles demonstrated that they came with the authority of God through the miracles they performed as Jesus and the Prophets did before them. The book of Acts, which records the miracles of the apostles, has also proven to be a historically accurate record written by a first century eyewitness.</p><h3>Prophecy</h3><p>Many religious books claim to be divinely inspired, but only the Bible has evidence of supernatural confirmation. We have seen that Jesus, being God incarnate, affirms the inspiration of the Bible. Another evidence of supernatural confirmation is the testimony of prophecy. The biblical authors made hundreds of specific prophecies of future events that have come to pass in the manner they were predicted. No book in history can compare to the Bible when it comes to the fulfillment of prophecy.</p><p>Here are some examples. Ezekiel 26, which was written in 587 B.C., predicted the destruction of Tyre, a city made up of two parts: a mainland port city, and an island city half a mile off shore. Ezekiel prophesied that Nebuchadnezzar would destroy the city, many nations would fight against her, the debris of the city would be thrown into the ocean, the city would never be found again, and fishermen would come there to lay their nets.</p><p>In 573 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the mainland city of Tyre. Many of the refugees of the city sailed to the island, and the island city of Tyre remained a powerful city. In 333 B.C., however, Alexander the Great laid siege to Tyre. Using the rubble of mainland Tyre, he built a causeway to the island city of Tyre. He then captured and completely destroyed the city.</p><p>Today, Tyre is a small fishing town where fishing boats come to rest and fisherman spread their nets. The great ancient city of Tyre to this day lies buried in ruins exactly as prophesied. If we were to calculate the odds of this event happening by chance, the figures would be astronomical. No, it was not by coincidence.{2}</p><p>Here’s another example. There are nearly one hundred prophecies made about Jesus in the Old Testament, prophecies such as His place of birth, how he would die, His rejection by the nation of Israel, and so on. All these prophecies were made hundreds of years before Jesus ever came to earth. Because of the accuracy of the prophecies, many skeptics have believed that they must have been written after A.D. 70after the birth and death of Jesus and the destruction of Jerusalem. They have thereby tried to deny that they are even prophecies.</p><p>However, in 1947 the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. These scrolls contained the book of Isaiah and other prophetic books. When dated, they were found to be written from 120 to 100 B.C.,{3} well before Jesus was born. It would have been an incredible accomplishment for Jesus to have fulfilled the numerous prophecies. Some say these prophecies were fulfilled by chance, but the odds against this would be exceptionally large. It would take more a greater leap of faith to believe in that chance happening than in the fact that Jesus is God and these prophecies are divinely inspired.</p><p>The record of prophecy is thus evidence for the unique and supernatural origin of the Bible.</p><h3>Unity</h3><p>The Bible is the only book with supernatural confirmation to support its claim of divine inspiration. The testimony of Christ and the legacy of prophecy are two proofs for inspiration. A third line of evidence is the unity of the Bible.</p><p>The Bible covers hundreds of topics, yet it does not contradict itself. It remains united in its theme. Well, what’s so amazing about that? you may ask. Consider these facts. First, the Bible was written over a span of fifteen hundred years. Second, it was written by more than forty men from every walk of life. For example, Moses was educated in Egypt, Peter was a fisherman, Solomon was a king, Luke was a doctor, Amos was a shepherd, and Matthew was a tax collector. All the writers were of vastly different occupations and backgrounds.</p><p>Third, it was written in many different places. The Bible was written on three different continents: Asia, Africa, and Europe. Moses wrote in the desert of Sinai, Paul wrote in a prison in Rome, Daniel wrote in exile in Babylon, and Ezra wrote in the ruined city of Jerusalem.</p><p>Fourth, it was written under many different circumstances. David wrote during a time of war, Jeremiah wrote at the sorrowful time of Israel’s downfall, Peter wrote while Israel was under Roman domination, and Joshua wrote while invading the land of Canaan.</p><p>Fifth, the writers had different purposes for writing. Isaiah wrote to warn Israel of God’s coming judgment on their sin; Matthew wrote to prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah; Zechariah wrote to encourage a disheartened Israel who had returned from Babylonian exile; and Paul wrote addressing problems in different Asian and European churches.</p><p>If we put all these factors togetherthe Bible was written over fifteen hundred years by forty different authors at different places, under various circumstances, and addressing a multitude of issueshow amazing that with such diversity, the Bible proclaims a unified message! That unity is organized around one theme: God’s redemption of man and all of creation. The writers address numerous controversial subjects yet contradictions never appear. The Bible is an incredible document.</p><p>Let me offer you a good illustration. Suppose ten medical students graduating in the same year from medical school wrote position papers on four controversial subjects.</p><p>Would they all agree on each point? No, we would have disagreements from one author to another. Now look at the authorship of the Bible.</p><p>All these authors, from a span of fifteen hundred years, wrote on many controversial subjects, yet they do not contradict one another.</p><p>It seems one author guided these writers through the whole process: the Holy Spirit. 2 Peter 1:21 states, No prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. The unity of the Bible is just one more amazing proof of the divine inspiration and authority of the Bible.</p><h3>Archaeology</h3><p>Weve studied the testimony of Jesus, prophecy, and the unity of the Bible as providing supernatural confirmation of the divine inspiration of the Bible. Another line of evidence is archaeology. Archaeology does not directly prove the Bibles inspiration, but it does prove its historical reliability.</p><p>Middle Eastern archaeological investigations have proven the Bible to be true and unerringly accurate in its historical descriptions. Nelson Glueck, a renowned Jewish archaeologist, states, No archaeological discovery has ever controverted a biblical reference.{4} Dr. William Albright, who was probably the foremost authority in Middle East archaeology in his time, said this about the Bible: There can be no doubt that archaeology has confirmed the substantial historicity of the Old Testament.{5} At this time, the number of archaeological discoveries that relate to the Bible number in the hundreds of thousands.{6}</p><p>Archaeology has verified numerous ancient sites, civilizations, and biblical characters whose existence was questioned by the academic world and often dismissed as myths. Biblical archaeology has silenced many critics as new discoveries supported the facts of the Bible.</p><p>Here are a few examples of the historical accuracy of the Bible. The Bible records that the Hittites were a powerful force in the Middle East from 1750 B.C. until 1200 B.C. (Genesis 15:20, 2 Samuel 11, and 1 Kings 10:29). Prior to the late nineteenth century, nothing was known of the Hittites outside the Bible, and many critics alleged that they were an invention of the biblical authors.</p><p>However, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, archaeologists in Turkey discovered a city which proved to be the capital of the Hittite empire. In the city they discovered a massive library of thousands of tablets. These tablets showed that the Hittite language was an early relative of the Indo-European languages.</p><p>Another example is the story of Jericho recorded in the book of Joshua. For years, skeptics thought the story of the falling walls of Jericho was a myth. However, recent archaeological discoveries have led several prominent scholars to conclude that the biblical description of the fall of Jericho is consistent with the discoveries they have made. One of the leading archaeologists on Jericho presently is Dr. Bryant Wood. His research has shown that the archaeological evidence matches perfectly with the biblical record.{7}</p><p>Archaeology has also demonstrated the accuracy of the New Testament. One of the most well attested to New Testament authors is Luke. Scholars have found him to be a very accurate historian, even in many of his details. In the Gospel of Luke and Acts, Luke names thirty-two countries, fifty-four cities, and nine islands without error.{8} A. N. Sherwin-White states, For Acts the confirmation of historicity is overwhelming. . . . Any attempt to reject its basic historicity must now appear absurd. Roman historians have long taken it for granted.{9}</p><p>There is no other ancient book that has so much archaeological evidence to support its accounts. Since God is a God of truth, we should expect His revelation to present what is historically true. Archaeology presents tangible proof of the historical accuracy of the Bible.</p><h3>The Bible Alone Is Gods Word</h3><p>We have given several proofs for the divine inspiration of the Bible. These include the testimony of Jesus the divine Son of God, prophecy, unity, and archaeology. Accepting the divine inspiration of the Bible leads to the conclusion that all other works cannot be divinely inspired. This does not mean other works do not contain truth. All people are created in the image of God and can articulate principles that are true. However, only the Bible proves to be divinely inspired by God and therefore, other claims of divine inspiration should be ruled out for several reasons.</p><p>The Bible is the only book that gives supernatural confirmation to support its claim of divine inspiration. Other scriptures which contradict it cannot, therefore, be true.</p><p>The law of non-contradiction states that two contradictory statements cannot be true at the same time. If one proposition is known to be true, its opposite must be false. If it is true that I am presently alive, it cannot also be true to say that I am presently not alive. This is a universal law which is practiced daily in every part of the world. Even if you claim, the law of non-contradiction is false, you are asserting this statement is true and its opposite is false. In other words you end up appealing to the law you are trying to deny thus making a self-defeating argument.</p><p>Since we have good reason to believe the Bible is the inspired word of God, any teaching that contradicts the Bible must be false. The Bible makes exclusive claims regarding God, truth and salvation that would exclude other scriptures. The Bible teaches that any deity other than the God of the Bible is a false deity (Exodus 20). Jesus declared that he is the divine Son of God, the source of truth, and the only way to eternal life (John 1 &amp; 14:6).</p><p>A look at a few works from other religions illustrates this point. The Hindu scriptures include the Vedas and the Upanishads. These books present views of God that are contrary to the Bible. The Vedas are polytheistic, and the Upanishads present a pantheistic worldview of an impersonal divine essence called Brahma, not a personal God.</p><p>The Koran, the holy book of Islam, denies the deity of Christ, the triune nature of God, and the atoning work of Christ on the cross (Sura 4:116, 168). These are foundational truths taught in the Bible. The Pali Canon, the holy scriptures of Southern Buddhism, teach a naturalistic worldview (or pantheistic, as some schools interpret it). It also teaches salvation by works and the doctrine of reincarnation. The worldview of the Pali Canon and its view of salvation contradict biblical teachings. Since these works contradict biblical teaching, we reject their claim to divine inspiration.</p><p>The Bible alone proves to be divinely inspired and its exclusive claims rule out the claims of other books.</p><p>Read my short book for free. <a href="http://prophecyrevealed.com/friendbook9thPrinting.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here to read it now.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Notes:</h3><p>1.

Decide on the important things and begin. If you are budget conscious, acquire things a little at a time. Make choices at the grocery store. Instead of buying the name brand, maybe consider the store brand and buy 2. Most stores have buy-one, get-one offers. Coupons can be very helpful and often there are ‘free’ offers.</p><p>Network with your family, congregation, and like-minded neighbors. We are collectively smarter than our individual selves. Research for yourself. Go online and find expert advice. There is a lot of noise out there. Some people offering advice are self-serving. Pray for God’s discernment to guide you.</p><p>Some of us have learned lessons, and sometimes it’s what not to do.</p><p>“Failing to plan is planning to fail.”</p><p>“Plan the work. Work the plan.”</p><p>One bulb at a time</p><p>The story of the Daffodil Garden in Running Springs, CA tells us that Alma Gene Bauer and her husband Dale started in 1958 planting bulbs that for 3 weeks each year bring people from all over to gaze in wonder through 5 acres of color. When asked how she accomplished such a feat, Mrs. Bauer said “one bulb at a time.” Your plans need to start one bulb at a time.</p><h1><strong>Water</strong></h1><p><strong>NOTICE that you are reading this on your computer. Notice that in order to get further information you go onto the Internet.&nbsp;It is urgent that you print out this and every other section NOW while you still have electricity. Get a 3 ring binder and place all important information by section into the binder. Do it NOW!</strong></p><h3>If your faucet suddenly did not work, where would you find water?</h3><p>By the time your water no longer comes out of the faucet, you would know that your power has been off. You would also have had to deal with the mess in your freezer. Dealing with the mess is even harder when there is no water to clean with.</p><h3>How much water do I need?</h3><p>Government sources estimate 1 gallon per person per day of clean water. Physical exertion and stress can easily increase the amount you need.</p><p>Choices</p><ul><li>Find a water source before you need it</li><li>Find a water source after you need it</li></ul><p>Finding a water source before you need it expands your choices. Obviously, if you wait, choices become limited.</p><p>Before options:</p><ul><li>Gather water and store it. But, how much can you really store?</li><li>Find a source that can be replenished with rain water</li><li>Find a source that is already ready to drink, such as a well</li><li>Find a source that can be treated and made safe to drink</li></ul><h2><strong>Storing Water</strong></h2><p>What kind of containers can I use to store water?</p><p>There are many commercially available options as well as many re-use options.</p><p>Food-grade plastic or glass containers are suitable for storing water. One-, three- and five-gallon water containers can be purchased from most outdoor or hardware stores. Any plastic or glass container that previously held food or beverages such as 2-liter soda bottles or water, juice, punch or milk jugs, also may be used. Stainless steel can be used to store water which has not been or will not be treated with chlorine; chlorine is corrosive to most metals.</p><p>55 gal drums, designed specifically for water storage can be difficult to transport, if the need arises, but are of a tremendous value in an emergency .When looking for additional food grade containers, the bottom will be stamped with HDPE (High Density PolyEthylene) and coded with the recycle symbol and a “2″ inside. HDPE containers are FDA-approved for food. Containers without these designations aren’t OK because of possible chemical interactions between the water and the plastic.</p><p>Clean used containers and lids with hot soapy water. Once they have been thoroughly cleaned, rinse them with water and sanitize the containers and lids by rinsing them with a solution of 1 tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Leave the containers wet for two minutes, then rinse them again with water. Remember to remove the paper or plastic lid liners before washing the lids. It is very difficult to effectively remove all residue from many containers, so carefully clean hard-to-reach places like the handles of milk jugs. To sanitize stainless steel containers, place the container in boiling water for 10 minutes. Never use containers that previously held chemicals.</p><p>Use the following guidelines when storing water:</p><p>1. Store drinking water in carefully cleaned, non-corrosive, tightly covered containers.</p><p>2. Store containers in a cool dark place. DO NOT store in direct sunlight. Polyethylene plastics (prepackaged milk and water bottles) are somewhat permeable to hydrocarbon vapors. Keep away from stored gasoline, kerosene, pesticides, or similar substances.</p><p>3. Stored tap water should be rotated every 6 months. Prepackaged bottled water should be rotated once a year. Check the pull date on the container. Be sure it didn’t sit on the store’s shelf for a year before you purchased it. Self-serve bottled water should be rotated once a year.</p><p>4. Rotate your stored water with the water you use on a regular basis. This practice helps insure you don’t have water stored longer than one year.</p><p><strong>Water logistics</strong></p><p>The biggest problem with water is how big and heavy it is. Since a gallon of water weighs just over 8 pounds and takes up just over 1/7th of a cubic foot, it is impractical for most people in an urban area to store water for an extended survival situation. In most urban areas, it is harder to find water and make it drinkable than in a wilderness area. There are two main reasons for this: 1. Proximity &amp; 2. Polluted water. Contaminants in water can be very tiny and there is no perfect way to eliminate all of them.</p><h3>How can I save rain water?</h3><ul><li>Rain barrels</li><li>Buckets</li><li>Bathtubs</li></ul><h3>Is rainwater collected from a roof safe to drink?</h3><p>There is no long-term research on this topic and what little research there is available does not build consensus. Best advice is to filter the water or treat with bleach, but not chlorine, as chlorine may cause a reaction with carbons that are washed off during a rainstorm. Water collected from a metal roof is better than water from asphalt shingles.</p><h3>Can a well work without an electric pump?</h3><p>One idea might be to find a like-minded neighbor and offer to help pay for a manual pump to be installed.</p><h3>What are some hidden sources of water?</h3><ul><li>Hot water tank, but you have to know how to get it out</li><li>Reverse osmosis tank under your sink</li><li>Toilet tank. I know this doesn’t sound appealing, but the water is potable.</li><li>Some parks and playgrounds have manual pumps that lead to an underground well</li><li>Your own urine (up to 3 times before it’s too salty)</li></ul><h3>What are some ways to store water?</h3><ul><li>Food grade containers.</li><li>2 liter soda bottles that have been rinsed clean</li><li>Water bladders that can be filled and stay in your bathtub</li><li>Individual water bottles</li><li>Large water jugs like those used on commercial water cooler</li><li>Water barrels</li><li>Emergency water cans</li></ul><h3>What is a rain barrel?</h3><p>A <strong>rain barrel</strong> is a system that collects and stores rainwater from your roof that would otherwise be lost to runoff and diverted to storm drains and streams. Normally, a rain gutter or downspout diverts water to a large drum of various sizes. In normal usage, collected water is used to water plants during times of lower rainfall. Some have a screen to keep out sediment, leaves, and insects. A hose is sometimes connected to the bottom to drain the water. Ideally, the rain barrel would be elevated to create pressure to increase water flow out of the hose. Rain barrels also frequently have decorative touches and may have an area suitable for plants.</p><h3>What is a water barrel?</h3><p>Often the term ‘<strong>water barrel</strong>’ is used interchangeably with a rain barrel, but there are some important differences. While a rain barrel has an opening that is designed to catch water as from a downspout, a water barrel does not. A water barrel has 2 bung hole openings that allow water to flow in at a rapid rate and then can be sealed with caps. Typically, a water barrel is 55 gallons and previously held a food-grade substance and has been rinsed clean.</p><h3>What about my pool? Can I use that as a reservoir?</h3><p>Yes, up to a point. As you know in Florida, pool surfaces need regular cleaning and chlorination. A passive chlorinator will keep your water fresh for a while. Pool water might best be thought of to use for other purposes. Having a source of algaecide, muriatic acid, and chlorine will increase the life of your pool as a reservoir. Using your pool skimmer to keep leaves and other wind-blown debris out will also help.</p><h3>How do I treat water to make it fit to drink?</h3><p>From the CDC:</p><p>“Water often can be made safe to drink by boiling, adding disinfectants, or filtering. Additionally, Ultraviolet (UV) Light, and Solar Radiation can be used.</p><p>IMPORTANT: Water contaminated with fuel or toxic chemicals will not be made safe by boiling or disinfection. Use a different source of water if you know or suspect that water might be contaminated with fuel or toxic chemicals.</p><h2><strong>Boiling</strong></h2><p>If you don’t have safe bottled water, you should boil water to make it safe. Boiling is the surest method to make water safer to drink by killing disease-causing organisms, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites.</p><p>You can improve the flat taste of boiled water by pouring it from one container to another and then allowing it to stand for a few hours, OR by adding a pinch of salt for each quart or liter of boiled water.</p><p>If the water is cloudy,</p><ul><li>Filter it through a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter OR allow it to settle.</li><li>Draw off the clear water.</li><li>Bring the clear water to a rolling boil for one minute (at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for three minutes).</li><li>Let the boiled water cool.</li><li>Store the boiled water in <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/safe_water/personal.html#containers\\" target=\\"_blank\\">clean sanitized containers</a> with tight covers.</li></ul><p>If the water is clear,</p><ul><li>Bring the clear water to a rolling boil for one minute (at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for three minutes).</li><li>Let the boiled water cool.</li><li>Store the boiled water in <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/safe_water/personal.html#containers\\" target=\\"_blank\\">clean sanitized containers</a> with tight covers.</li></ul><h2><strong>The Truth about Boiling Water</strong></h2><p>I know you’ve probably heard for years that you have to heat water to boiling to make it drinkable, but you don’t need to boil water to kill everything in it. You can simply pasteurize it by heating it to 158 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2><strong>Disinfectants</strong></h2><p>If you don’t have safe bottled water and if boiling is not possible, you often can make water safer to drink by using a disinfectant such as unscented household chlorine bleach or iodine. These can kill most harmful organisms, such as viruses and bacteria, but are not as effective in controlling more resistant organisms such as the parasites <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Cryptosporidium</a> and <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/disease/giardia.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Giardia</a>.</p><p>To disinfect water,</p><ul><li>Filter it through a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter OR allow it to settle.</li><li>Draw off the clear water.</li><li>To use bleach, add 1/8 teaspoon (or 8 drops; about 0.625 milliliters) of unscented liquid household chlorine (5-6%) bleach for each gallon of clear water (or 2 drops of bleach for each liter or each quart of water),</li></ul><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Stir the mixture well.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it stand for 30 minutes or longer before you use it.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;Store the disinfected water in <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/safe_water/personal.html#containers\\" target=\\"_blank\\">clean sanitized containers</a> with tight covers.</p><ul><li>To use iodine, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for tablets. Iodine Tincture with 2% Iodine and about 47% alcohol can also be used. Bottles of this solution should be available at your local drugstore and a 2 oz. bottle is usually $3 or less. Use 8 drops per liter, if water is clear. If water is cloudy double the drops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait 30 minutes before drinking and ensure the spout of the container has been disinfected with the iodine and water solution.</li></ul><p>Chlorine dioxide tablets are another disinfectant that now is available in some outdoor stores. This disinfectant has proven to be effective against pathogens, including <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Cryptosporidium</a>, if the manufacturer’s instructions are followed.</p><h2><strong>Filters</strong></h2><p>Many portable water filters can remove disease-causing parasites such as <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Cryptosporidium</a> and <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/disease/giardia.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Giardia</a> from drinking water. If you are choosing a portable water filter, try to pick one that has a filter pore size small enough to remove both bacteria and parasites. Most portable water filters do not remove viruses.</p><p>Carefully read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the water filter you intend to use. After filtering, add a disinfectant such as iodine, chlorine, or chlorine dioxide to the filtered water to kill any viruses and remaining bacteria. For more information about water filters, see the <a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/safe_water/personal.html#make_safe_water_treatment_resources\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Water Treatment Resources</a> section.</p><h2><strong>Water Treatment Resources</strong></h2><p>To learn more about water filters and treatments that can remove microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites (such as Cryptosporidium), see the following resources:</p><ul><li><a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/gen_info/filters.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">A Guide to Water Filters</a></li><li><a href=\\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">A Guide to Drinking Water Treatment and Sanitation for Backcountry and Travel Use</a> covers information on the effectiveness of various water treatment methods.

Boiling water will kill most types of disease-causing organisms that may be present. If the water is cloudy, filter it through clean cloths or allow it to settle, and draw off the clear water for boiling. Boil the water for one minute, let it cool, and store it in clean containers with covers.</li><li>If you can’t boil water, you can disinfect it using household bleach. Bleach will kill some, but not all, types of disease-causing organisms that may be in the water. If the water is cloudy, filter it through clean cloth or allow it to settle, and draw off the clear water for disinfection. Add 1⁄8 teaspoon (or 8 drops) of regular, unscented, liquid household bleach for each gallon of water, stir it well and let it stand for 30 minutes before you use it. Store disinfected water in clean containers with covers.</li><li>If you have a well that has been flooded, the water should be tested and disinfected after flood waters recede. If you suspect that your well may be contaminated, contact your local or state health department or agriculture extension agent for specific advice.</li></ol><h2><strong>Other sources of Disinfection</strong></h2><h3>Ultraviolet (UV) Light</h3><p>Portable units that deliver a measured dose of UV light are an effective way to disinfect small quantities of clear water. However, this technique is less effective in cloudy water, since germs may be shielded from the light by small particles.</p><h3>Solar Radiation</h3><p>In an emergency situation, water can be disinfected with sunlight. Water in a clear plastic bottle, preferably lying on a reflective surface (such as aluminum foil), will be safe to drink after a minimum of 6 hours in bright sunlight. This technique does not work on cloudy water.”</p><h3>Water Purification Iodine or Iodine Tablets</h3><p>These tablets are sold commercially and at retail outlets and are popular with campers and the military. Tablets prove effective against giardia lamblia when used as directed. They are intended for short term or limited emergency use only. Water is ready in about 30-35 minutes.</p><h3>How much water can I treat with a single iodine tablet?</h3><p>Usually a quart or liter per tablet for clear water. For murky water, it usually requires 2 tablets per quart or liter. The instructions are usually on the side of the bottle.</p><h3>In order to boil water, don’t I need some way to make a fire?</h3><p>Yes. The fire could be built using firewood, propane (like a gas grill), or some other fuel source. One thing to keep in mind when you are trying to boil water is that most people don’t have a separate burner on a grill. Most modern pots and pans have plastic handles that will melt if too close to a flame. Cast iron skillets and pots are best if available.</p><h3>Without running water, how do I wash my hands?</h3><p>As we know from scripture, having running water is the best way to prevent the spread of germs and disease. Many camping supply sources have options, including pump devices. Home supply stores have spray pumps that are inexpensive, but perhaps a little hard to hold. Of course, you may have someone in your household to pour water while you wash.</p><h3>Without running water, how am I supposed to bathe?</h3><p>Camping supply stores have some options that allow you to use the heat of the sun to heat up water in bags that can be suspended. Some homemade options found on the internet demonstrate using metal trash cans painted black and PVC pipe mounted on a structure high enough to stand under. An easy way to bathe and conserve resources such as fresh water is to bathe using a wash cloth. This takes less than a quart of water and can be done in a warm or cold climate.</p><p>A water-less bathing option is to use <strong>baby wipes</strong>.</p><h3>Do caffeinated fluids contribute to your daily fluid requirement?</h3><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, “drinking caffeine-containing beverages as part of a normal lifestyle doesn’t cause fluid loss in excess of the volume ingested. While caffeinated drinks may have a mild diuretic effect — meaning that they may cause the need to urinate — they don’t appear to increase the risk of dehydration.”</p><h3>Does alcohol contribute to how much water I need to drink?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><h3>How do I make water taste better?</h3><p>There are a variety of liquid and powder additives designed to increase the flavor of water. Some, like sport drinks, not only taste good, but add essentials salts and minerals that replenish the body during and after physical exertion. Other items, add no calories, but are designed to provide fruit flavors. Additives have a limited shelf life, but generally can be stored for several months before use.</p><h3>Where do I find outside water sources?</h3><p>Get a printed map of your location that shows where the lakes, ponds, and creeks are found. Don’t rely on having an electronic device with a map. The same map can also be used to mark the location of other resources such as farms, orchards, and nurseries. You might want to stay away from golf courses as the heavy use of chemicals may taint the small ponds or lakes.</p><h3>Can I make water without rain?</h3><p>Yes, using a solar still.</p><p>In short, you dig a hole, put a clean container in the middle to collect the water that you’re going to drink, put your urine or other questionable water around the clean container, cover the hole with plastic, secure the plastic to the sides of the hole, and put a small rock on the plastic so that the low point is directly over your clean container. The sun’s UV rays will go through the plastic and cause the water to evaporate. The evaporated moisture will condense and collect on the plastic and flow to the lowest point (right over your clean container) and drip into your clean container. If you’ve run a drinking tube from the clean container to the outside of the solar still, you can start drinking or collecting water without taking the still apart.</p><p>These stills will work, but they are not very efficient and introduce some risk of contaminants. A still that is 4 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep can produce approximately a quart of water per day in the desert or more if you add liquids to it. <a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI0W3VNPna4\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI0W3VNPna4</a></p><h2><strong>Rain Barrel D-I-Y</strong></h2><ul><li>Start with a heavy duty rolled cart.

We will not go into detail to discuss here but do some internet searching. You have the tools in your kitchen to accomplish this task if need be.</p><p>You can also use cloth to soak up the morning dew on the grass and plants then squeeze out the water. This technique usually doesn’t require disinfecting. Of course, I wouldn’t use a dirty sock.</p><h1><strong>Sources</strong></h1><p><a href=\\"http://BePrepared.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BePrepared.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://beprepared.com/blog/16315/how-to-desalinate-water?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=NATIONAL%20-%20Promotions&amp;utm_campaign=emer0715%20-%20INEM2720&amp;utm_content=B&amp;sc=EMAIL&amp;oc=INEM2720b\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Water Desalination</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://CDC.gov\\" target=\\"_blank\\">CDC.gov</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://REI.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">REI.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://EndTimesReport.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">EndTimesReport.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://bigberkeywaterfilters.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">bigberkeywaterfilters.com</a> (water filter)</p><p><a href=\\"http://campingsurvival.com/lifestraw.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">campingsurvival.com/lifestraw.html</a> (water filter)</p><p><a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2Q0T4/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\\" target=\\"_blank\\">amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2Q0T4/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Portable hot water shower)</p><p><a href=\\"http://eattheweeds.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">eattheweeds.com</a> (food that grows all around us)</p><p><a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EJ11X2/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\\" target=\\"_blank\\">www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EJ11X2/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a> (sprouting)</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>How to Survive Anything, Anywhere A Handbook of Survival Skills for Every Scenario and Environment – </em>Chris McNab</p><p><em>How to Survive the End of the World as we Know it</em> – James Wesley, Rawles</p><p><em>Wilderness Survival</em>, second edition – Gregory J.

Work the plan.”</p><h1>Preface</h1><p>This isn’t an easy subject. Most of us have spent the bulk of our lives with conveniences such as steady electricity, clean running water, major appliances, automobiles, and an increasingly larger service industry. <strong>The greatest threat to our survival comes from our normal standard of living.</strong> We have had the luxury of moving about freely and enjoying much of what modern life has to offer. To have all of that interrupted will come as a major shock. We have recent history of hurricanes, earthquakes, major forest fires, floods, and tornados upon which we have seen humanity suffer here in the US. To some extent we rely on organizations such as the American Red Cross, FEMA, and faith-based charities to ease the loss and suffering. How much can we rely if the emergency is greater than 1 city or 1 state?</p><p>It is better that you are knowledgeable and prepared. We tend to fear what we don’t know. <strong>Knowledge is the best asset you have.</strong> Read, learn, try, and repeat until you have it mastered. Write down what is important based on your needs and how you will meet those needs. By having a plan that is well thought out with contingencies, you simply have to put it into action when the time comes. Decisions are easier when you are calm, relaxed, and have time to think.</p><p>We are creatures of mind, body, and spirit. Mentally we have to <strong>visualize ourselves getting through any ordeal we find ourselves in.</strong> I listened to Philip Gans, a holocaust survivor, talk about keeping hope alive by looking forward to the time when he and his father would be out of the concentration camp. Much like we’ve learned in the healing services, our mind has the power to unlock so much potential via the Holy Spirit that lives within us. “I can do this!” has to be your motto. Additionally, our bodies have grown soft. Exercise is important, now, so that your options, later, are increased. Our bodies have a natural fight or flight mechanism built in that increases blood flow and adrenaline when we need it. A strong body gives you the best chance to not only survive, but thrive during an emergency. Think of the Amish. They live without electricity, walk wherever they go, and make their own food and clothes. They are happy and healthy and can <strong>distinguish between needs and wants.</strong></p><p>If your home (shelter) is compromised, obviously that becomes higher in importance than other needs. Have plans in place that include contingencies. In other words, have a Plan A, Plan B, and a Plan C. Be adaptive to your situation and take advantage of opportunities where you find them. Your ability to think clearly and act will put you at an advantage over others competing for the same resources. <strong>Make a plan that fits you and your family.</strong></p><h1><strong>Food</strong></h1><p>NOTICE that you are reading this on your computer. Notice that in order to get further information you go onto the Internet. It is Urgent that you print out this and every other section NOW while you still have electricity. Get a 3 ring binder and place all important info by section in the binder. Do it NOW!</p><p><strong>If the food supply in your area were suddenly interrupted, what would you do?</strong></p><p>You may have a certain amount of short-term foods. Many things normally stored in a refrigerator or freezer will spoil without electricity to keep them cold. Do you have enough food in your pantry to last you and your family for more than 2-3 weeks?</p><p>In an emergency, eat things that will spoil first. You should eat things in the refrigerator first, then the freezer, then fruits and vegetables, then dried foods. Avoid opening the refrigerator/freezer often. Do you have a generator that could supply electricity to a refrigerator/freezer during short term emergencies? Although a generator is very useful during a short term power outage, it will be ineffective if fuel cannot be acquired to run the generator. How much fuel do you have? Do you have a plan to ration the fuel in your cars and fuel cans or will you need the fuel in your car to execute your bug out plan to your alternate location? These are things you need to consider while developing your plan. Food will run out quickly in urban areas and there will be increasing competition for food and resources. You must have a plan for long term food replacement or you must be willing and have a plan to move to a location that has resources to support you and your family. The rule for food preparation is that you must have enough food to support your family until you can replace that food. It doesn’t rain food every few weeks so you must have a plan to grow food or hunt it. You must have enough food stored to feed your family in order for you to start growing your own or hunting it.</p><p>Many people go to the store once a week (or more). You probably don’t think of that “extra” food as survival food, but that extra can be the beginning of your food storage pantry. The food in your pantry may help you get by for a short period of time if you can’t get to the store. A three-day supply of short-term “food storage” in the pantry is typical for most households.</p><p><strong>How do I build up my food supply?</strong></p><p>If you live in an apartment or townhome, building up a food supply is also compounded by lack of space. Think about building up at least a week’s supply of short-term foods you can throw into the cupboard. Look for ways to consolidate items to create space. Maybe consider selling or donating some items no longer used. Consider the importance of having emergency food versus the clutter. If you are budget conscious, acquire things a little at a time. Make choices at the grocery store. Instead of buying the name brand, maybe consider the store brand and buy 2. Most stores have buy-one, get-one offers. Coupons can be very helpful and often there are ‘free’ offers. Look at labels to see how much shelf life something has. Choose items that are pasteurized and do not require refrigeration (at least until opened).</p><p>Which items do you have that require microwave heating to cook? Those will have less value in an emergency.</p><h2><strong>CALORIES COUNT</strong></h2><p>Calories are a crucial factor in your food storage planning. To determine your family’s food storage needs, think first in terms of calories per person per day, and then in terms of nutrients (protein, vitamins and minerals) provided—and finally, in terms of cost per serving. Measuring servings isn’t reliable because a cup of orange drink, a cup of beef stroganoff, a tablespoon of butter, and a quarter teaspoon of salt all count as a “serving.” Depending upon the food choices, a person could consume three servings a day and only get 600 calories!</p><p>In high-stress situations we require more calories than usual to operate in peak condition. According to the government’s dietary guidelines, under normal situations most adults need around 2,000 to 2,600 calories per day—more if very active or highly stressed. Children usually need 1,500 to 1,600 calories per day.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>Stress can have more powerful effects on the human body than is often thought, producing changes in the function of the endocrine system and therefore on the hormones the body produces. A craving for carbohydrates is a common response to stress hormones, as sugar is the quickest way to replenish muscles that would have been needed in the fight or flight response. Sometimes we eat for comfort. The mind can contribute to the amount and type of food we choose to eat. Higher carbs give a higher sense of satisfaction and we often learn to satisfy stress with comfort foods.</p><p>Stress can also have the opposite effect which is to shut down desire to eat. Serious ongoing stress can lead to anxiety, which can often trigger unintentional weight loss. Anxiety can lead to a loss of appetite, abdominal pains, or a feeling of fullness soon after beginning to eat, resulting in less food intake.</p><p><strong>What about multi-vitamins?</strong></p><p>Yes. These are very valuable to keep on hand particularly if you food options are limited. Supplements, such as Vitamin C, are also good to have around.</p><h2><strong>Long-term food supply</strong></h2><p><strong>What is the difference between freeze-dried and dehydrated?</strong></p><p>A lot of people use the terms dehydrated and freeze-dried like they are the same thing. However, there are some major differences between dehydrated and freeze-dried food storage.</p><p>With any type of food preservation, moisture needs to be removed from the food. The most common way to do this is by <a href=\\"http://www.thereadystore.com/food-storage/preparation-method/dehydrated-food-storage\\" target=\\"_blank\\">dehydrating</a>.</p><p>Modern day dehydration isn’t complex. Machines circulate hot and dry air across the food. This removes much of the water. The moist air is then dried so that water continues to be removed. The temperatures are high enough to remove water but not high enough to cook the food. Dehydrated food is usually withered and harder.</p><p>The freeze-drying process is a relatively modern preservation process. <a href=\\"http://www.thereadystore.com/food-storage/preparation-method/freeze-dried-food-storage\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Freeze-drying</a> isn’t something you can do at home without high-tech machinery.</p><p>Freeze-drying is a fairly simple process too. The food is placed on large racks inside of a vacuum chamber. The temperature is lowered to below freezing and then raised rapidly to above boiling. The process is so fast that it removes the moisture from the food without destroying the structure.</p><h2><strong>The Main Differences between freeze-dried and dehydrated foods</strong></h2><ul><li>Moisture Content. The main objective with food preservation is to remove the moisture so that the food doesn’t decompose, grow mold, etc. Dehydration removes about 90-95 percent of the moisture content while freeze drying removes about 98-99 percent.</li><li>Freeze-dried foods will have a longer average shelf life.</li><li>Freeze-dried foods retain the vast majority of the vitamins and minerals found in the original food.</li><li>Freeze-dried foods have a better appearance</li><li>Dehydrated foods will require cooking. Many times, they will also require some type of seasoning. This means that you’ll need to spend time boiling the product in hot water and letting it cook. However, with freeze-dried foods, you just need to add water. Adding either hot water or cold water will get the job done depending on what you’re eating. Freeze-dried foods will usually be ready to eat in less than 5 minutes.</li><li>Weight is another difference. Freeze-dried foods are going to weigh a lot less than dehydrated foods.</li><li>Dehydrated foods are going to be cheaper than freeze-dried</li></ul><h2><strong>Self-Reliance</strong></h2><p>100 years ago, people living outside of a city had to rely on their own skills to provide enough food for themselves and their families. Food sources consisted of what could be farmed, raised, fished, hunted, or gathered. Milk was made into cheese and berries were converted into jellies and preserves. Much like you would see today if you visited an Amish farm.</p><h2><strong>Hunting</strong></h2><p>Most of us live in urban and suburban environments. Hunting live game is somewhat impractical as there are few animals within walking distance. If you are able to hunt, most likely your weapon of choice would be a gun (shotgun or a rifle) or a bow with arrows. Florida has an abundance of birds, such as ibis and ducks, that offer a food choice for a few that are close enough, and a good enough shot!</p><p>Within Hillsborough County, Florida there are no public hunting grounds but there are public hunting lands within 60 miles and the local area is filled with eatable animals. In a large scale emergency, if you live in a highly urban area you might be required to go on a hunting trip several miles from your home in order to bring back food for your family. You may have to walk 10-20 miles or more to hunt. Then you might be required to carry that animal back to your family. In order to do that, you will need a weapon, skills to live in the field on your hunt, ability to clean and skin your harvest, and the skills to dry or smoke your meat so it will last the trip home and provide for your family for several days after your return. You must also think about your family’s security while you are away. This is where a network of people are extremely helpful. This is the way our country operated for several hundred years and was the norm. It is also the way Native Americans lived just over 100 years ago.</p><p>Hunting is not a skill easily learned and usually takes practice, time and effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also requires tools such as a firearm or bow to harvest the animal and a knife to clean and prepare the animal.</p><p>There are great resources available if one is unfamiliar with hunting or want to learn more if you are an avid hunter. A Good place to start is the link below which is an article from <em>American Hunter</em> magazine titled “25 Things Every Hunter Should Know”:</p><p><a href=\\"http://www.americanhunter.org/wp-content/uploads/Webcontent/pdf/2009-6/200964-25things.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.americanhunter.org/wp-content/uploads/Webcontent/pdf/2009-6/200964-25things.pdf</a></p><p>Magazines such as <em>American Hunter</em>, <em>Field and Stream</em> and <em>Outdoor Life</em> are great resources and one should consider a subscription to learn how to hunt, fish and trap. All three magazines also have informative websites. Outdoor Life also has a section dedicated to survival information.</p><h2><strong>Trapping</strong></h2><p>If you had traps, what would you catch that you would eat? Best option might be squirrel? Would you consider eating raccoon, opossum, or armadillo? These all have a risk of carrying a disease. You can make improvised traps/snares from wire or rope. You can also make improvised traps from sticks, rocks, and branches. You can also prepare ahead of time and use large rodent traps or raccoon/varmint traps that are usually available at home improvement stores. One trap will not suffice. Usually traps are set in multiples along game trails. This is called a trap line. The trapper must remember where he set the traps and return along the trap line regularly to glean the harvest and also to ensure other predators don’t steal the harvest. You also want your traps to be concealed from other humans or else they will steal the harvest as well.</p><h2><strong>Fishing</strong></h2><p>A simple $20 rod and spinning reel combo from a sporting goods store along with some simple lures such as jigs with plastic swim baits can go a long way to provide food on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add some split shot waits, bobbers, various hooks, and a few artificial swim baits and you can have a fishing kit for under $100. You will also need a filet knife.</p><p>Let’s say you are close enough to walk to a fishing spot and have equipment where you could fish. If someone sees you walking with a string of fish, how likely would you be stopped/attacked and the fish taken from you? Of course, you could eat the fish on the spot, but that means carrying other items with you which might attract attention.</p><h2><strong>Gathering</strong></h2><p>Gathering options might also be limited, even if you live next to a nature preserve. Would you be able to find blackberry or raspberry plants? Would you know rhubarb or edible mushrooms when you see them? Some things that look like food, like berries, are actually poisonous. Research now as there are plenty of books on the subject.</p><p><strong>What about cows?</strong></p><p>Florida has a lot of cows. If you managed to get a rope around one, where would you take it? And, let’s not forget, it’s not yours. How many of us know a dairy farmer within walking distance that would allow you to get your own milk?</p><p><strong>What about orchards and farms?</strong></p><p>Is fruit from a nursery or orchard fair to take? What about crops from an abandoned field? Would you be willing to get close enough to ask if you can buy or trade? Do you even know where these places are and are they within walking distance?</p><p>Fish, hunt, trap and gather with buddies. Buddies also secure the home front when others are on harvest trips. You need to think like a Native American or colonial community would think.</p><h2><strong>Canning</strong></h2><p>The concept of canning is simple: When food is processed in jars at extremely high temperatures for a long period of time, the heat kills microorganisms and deactivates enzymes that could cause the food to spoil. The heating process also drives air from the jar, creating a vacuum seal as the food cools. This prevents air, and the microorganisms it contains, from entering the jar and contaminating the food.</p><p>There are two types of canned foods: raw pack — uncooked food put into jars and processed; and hot pack — food that is heated before it is put into jars.</p><p>If you don’t already have the equipment, it might be more worthwhile to buy dehydrated or freeze-dried food.</p><h2><strong>Sprouting Seeds</strong></h2><p>Sprouting is the practice of germinating seeds to be eaten raw or cooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprouting seeds unlocks calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc which make it possible for you to absorb these nutrients. Germination also produces vitamin C and increases B vitamin content. This can be done inside your home year round without any special lighting.</p><h2><strong>Farming</strong></h2><p>So, could I plant my own seeds?</p><p>Sure, you could plant seeds, but where? Could you walk to it? How much land do you need to grow enough to feed you? Would these plants attract any attention from people or critters? You could grow a small number of things on your patio, but would the effort be worth it?</p><p><strong>What about raising animals?</strong></p><p>Chickens can be a source of eggs/meat. In an urban or suburban setting, raising chickens can be impractical, but not impossible. Silky chickens are well known to be a good species of chicken to raise in an urban environment. Some space is required and the chickens need shelter (coop) and a constant source of water and food. The chickens would have to be protected from predators and desperate people. Chickens make a little bit of noise, but not nearly as much as a rooster. Fresh eggs could sustain you for a long time and could be traded with someone you trust.</p><p><strong>How many butchers do you know?</strong></p><p>Even if you had an animal, such as a pig, chicken, or cow, how would you get it to someone who could slaughter and prepare it like you would have found it in the grocery store? Do you know how to clean and process the animal for consumption? Do you know how to smoke or dry the meat so nothing goes to waste and can be eaten several weeks later?</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h2><strong>Foraging for Edible Plants</strong></h2><p><a href=\\"http://beprepared.com/insight/13423/survival-101-foraging-for-edible-plants/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=National&amp;utm_campaign=emer0428%20-%20INEM2404&amp;utm_content=Final&amp;sc=EMAIL&amp;oc=INEM2404b\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://beprepared.com/insight/13423/survival-101-foraging-for-edible-plants/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=National&amp;utm_</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://beprepared.com/insight/13423/survival-101-foraging-for-edible-plants/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=National&amp;utm_campaign=emer0428%20-%20INEM2404&amp;utm_content=Final&amp;sc=EMAIL&amp;oc=INEM2404b\\" target=\\"_blank\\"> campaign=emer0428%20-%20INEM2404&amp;utm_content=Final&amp;sc=EMAIL&amp;oc=INEM2404b</a></p><h2>Foraging Rules</h2><p>If you’re new to foraging, you’ll want to establish some rules before you start looking for edible plants. For example, most people know that some mushrooms can be poisonous, so one of your rules might be to <em>stay away</em> from all mushrooms if you don’t know what’s poisonous and what’s not.</p><p>Foraging rules will keep you healthy and safe if you have to find wild plants to eat. Here are a couple of rules to get you started. Once you start foraging, you can add more of your own.</p><ol><li>Never eat anything if you’re not 100% sure of what it is.</li><li>Be careful of where you forage (make sure you know the landscape, holes, threats, rivers, etc.).</li><li>Stick with a few items you’re familiar with rather than spending hours searching for new plant species that might be dangerous.</li><li>Memorize a few different types of edible plants common to your area (grasses are common enough plants to most areas, so if you get lost in the woods out of your home state, you know that grass is one plant you can count on.)</li><li>Consult a field guide for preparation and cooking instructions for the plants (what if there’s a part of the plant that is inedible? You’ll want to know what to cut off and what to keep).</li><li>Watch out for animals.</li><li>Let someone know where you’re going before you go out foraging.</li></ol><p>Some of these rules might apply more once you know what to look for, but it’s good to have a couple of rules in mind before you go.</p><h2>Areas to Look for Edible Plants</h2><p>Since many edible plants are classified as weeds you can start looking for plants in your lawn or other areas that are regularly cleared like parks and fields. Also, depending on the region of the United States you live in, edible plants will grow in different areas of the landscape.</p><p>Generally, in humid regions, most of your edible plants will be found in a sunny area or clearing. In drier climates, your wild plants will be found near water sources.</p><p>Also, if you’re out in the woods or an unknown place, look for plants that are growing in abundance. Stay away from plants that you may only see one or two of in the area. If a plant is growing in large abundance, it is more likely to be non-toxic and edible. However, before eating that plant, <em>always</em> perform theuniversal edibility test&nbsp;(a test to determine if a plant will make you sick or not)&nbsp;on any plants you are not 100% sure of.</p><p>For a more detailed guide of where to find plants, you can purchase a plant guide specific to your state. Also,<em>The Sense of Survival</em>&nbsp;gives great tips about finding and preparing edible plants.</p><h2>How to Avoid Deadly Plants</h2><p>The Art of Manliness&nbsp;gives eight features of poisonous plants to watch out for:</p><ol><li>Milky or discolored sap</li><li>Spines, fine hairs, or thorns</li><li>Beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods</li><li>Bitter or soapy taste</li><li>Dill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley-like foliage</li><li>“Almond” scent in the woody parts and leaves</li><li>Grain heads with pink, purplish, or black spurs</li><li>Three-leaved growth pattern</li></ol><p><strong><em>Warning:</em></strong> The tricky thing about edible plants is that a lot of them have similar characteristics to poisonous ones, but they are still edible. Some plants even have parts that are ok to eat and other parts that are toxic. This is why it’s important to have a field guide to identify plants.</p><p>If you find a plant you think is edible but aren’t sure, you can test whether it’s poisonous or not by performing the Universal Edibility Test.</p><h2>5 Edible Plants to Know</h2><p><strong>Dandelion:</strong> Flower, leaves, stem, and root are all edible. Flowers taste best as a bud or at a barely-open stage in salads or sautéed in butter. The leaves (best young, in early spring) are highly nutritious, good in salads or stir-fry. The root (best in winter) needs to be&nbsp;parboiled (partially cooked in boiling water), then drained and boiled again until tender.</p><p><strong>Grasses</strong>: all grasses are edible, but it’s best to chew the leaves, swallow the juice, and spit out the tough fibers. Where the base of the leaves meets the root, there’s a small, white part called the corm, which can be roasted and eaten like potatoes.</p><p><strong>Cattails:</strong>the roots, shoots, and pollen heads are edible. For tips on eating cattail pollen, check out these great tips from the “Hunger and Thirst” Blog.</p><p><strong>GooseFoot:</strong> belongs to the same family as spinach, chard, and beets. The leaves of such varieties as “Lamb’s Quarters” are gathered and cooked as a vegetable.&nbsp;The seeds are called “quinoa,” a gluten-free grain-alternative quickly increasing in popularity as a cereal, side dish, or bread ingredient.</p><p><strong>Prickly Pear:</strong>this cactus-like plant grows from one to eight feet in height, and needs warm, dry, rocky soil. The pads resemble thick leaves and bear tufts of tiny, barbed bristles that are hard to see and harder to remove from the skin, so approach this plant with gloves and tongs! Using tongs, swish the fruit in water to remove the spines, and then carefully remove any remaining ones with a knife or peeler. The pads can be sliced and cooked for a vegetable (Nopalitos). The nutritious fruit can be used to make nectar, juice, jelly, candy, or pie. The branches can be roasted and peeled to get to edible pulp inside, and the seeds, parched and pulverized, are a good thickening agent.</p><p><strong>What is Aquaponics and should you&nbsp;incorporate it into your preparedness plans?</strong></p><p>Aquaponics is the practice of raising fish and vegetables together in a symbiotic relationship. In other words, it is the practice of raising fish in a tank and using the fish waste to fertilize the plants. The way it works is the water from the fish tank is pumped through the grow beds, where the beneficial bacteria convert the ammonia from the fish water into nitrites and then&nbsp;into nitrates that the plants feed on. The plants, in turn, filter out the ammonia, which is harmful to the fish; the water is then pumped back into the tank as clean, aerated water.</p><p>Aquaponics requires a pump and the fish die within a day or so if the pump stops as the oxygen in the water is used up.) Hydroponics is more realistic and can be manually maintained under emergency conditions.</p><p><strong>What is Hydroponics?</strong></p><p>Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in water. Almost any terrestrial plan will grow, with roots suspended, in a water/mineral solution.</p><h2><strong>MRE’s</strong></h2><p>MRE stands for Meal Ready to Eat. Popularized by the military, MRE’s have transitioned to civilian use and come a long way from a perception of something you wouldn’t dream of eating to something you would. MRE’s are nutritious and convenient emergency meals. Little or no heating required. Great for emergency use. Having a supply of MREs is a great way to eat hearty pre-cooked foods, crucial for a quick meal during an emergency. Stored in metalized pouches, they warm up quickly and easily open to enjoy. The on-the-go convenience of MREs makes them ideal for any emergency kit. You can also rotate these MRE meals into your camping, backpacking, or everyday meal planning.</p><p><strong>Can’t I just pre-position supplies somewhere?</strong></p><p>The first problem is the amount of preparation required to store something outside your home. The elements and insect problem would have to be solved. Next is location. Where can you put something where you are sure no one will take it? Third, how are you going to get to your stash in an emergency?</p><p><strong>What if someone knows I have food?</strong></p><p>It depends how desperate they are. The best advice is to let no one know you have food or emergency supplies. You may have to forcibly defend what you have.</p><p><strong>How do I choose where to get dehydrated or freeze-dried foods?</strong></p><ul><li>Order some samples and try them! One brand that has a large following is Mountain House. Another is Wise Food Storage.</li><li>Check online reviews</li><li>Ask around</li><li>Check the website FAQs</li></ul><p><strong>Are you planning to cook?</strong></p><p>Ingredients are less than for prepared recipes. So you could buy lots of ingredients and cook if you have plenty of heat source. Do you have an outdoor oven? Do you have utensils, pots, and pans that can take the heat from direct flame?</p><p><strong>What about seasonings, oil, butter?</strong></p><p>If you’re planning to cook, these are essential items. If you plan to eat game animals, seasonings are a must. Powdered butter is an option available for purchase.</p><p><strong>What about vitamins?</strong></p><p>Multi-vitamins are an excellent idea and have a reasonable shelf life.</p><p>Do you have a <strong>pet</strong>? When the dog food runs out then what will you do with your pet. Before you turn your nose up at the conversation, most of us do have pets. Pets are great, especially large dogs because they do provide a level of security to your family. However, there may come a time when tough choices must be made. 50lbs of meat is not something to scoff at or waste. Personally, eating the pet sounds more appealing than eating the cat or dog food. I recently heard a holocaust survivor give his testimony. Even after survivors were liberated and the war was over, there were still hard times in Europe. It came down to eating pets and they were thankful for the meal. I pray it never comes down to those choices for our family but you should be “prepared” to make those tough choices.</p><p><strong>How do I safeguard my food source?</strong></p><p>We will address this in a future section.</p><h2><strong>Bread</strong></h2><p>There are many benefits to grinding your own wheat to make bread. The flour we get in the store has lost much (not all) nutritional value. To make a yeast bread, you will need hard red or hard white wheat. To grind the flour you will want to have a manual mill. The manual mills will work when the lights go out; but will take longer, more effort, and produce a coarser flour. Cookbooks and recipes can be found on Breadbeckers.com. The ingredients for bread can be mixed in a large bowl, AND the dough can be kneaded by hand. BUT, few people will take the time to make a lot of bread, by hand.</p><p><a href=\\"http://www.homesteadharvest.com/article8.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.homesteadharvest.com/article8.html</a></p><p><strong>What’s in a Grain?</strong></p><p>To understand the benefits associated with milling grain, you need to understand what comprises a whole grain. There are three main layers: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm.</p><p>• The <strong>bran</strong> is the outer layer where all the roughage that helps move unwanted poisons and toxins through your system is found. The bran also contains numerous vitamins, minerals, and proteins.</p><p>• The <strong>germ</strong> is the health center of the grain, overflowing with vitamins B and E, as well as unsaturated fat and protein.</p><p>• The <strong>endosperm</strong> is the starchy white center.</p><p>Whole grains contain almost 90% of all the vitamins, minerals, and protein you’ll ever need. However, commercially milled products don’t offer you those nutrients. Why? Once milled, the oils found in the bran and germ oxidize and turn rancid within 72 hours. So for commercial purposes, both the bran and germ—and all the nutrients contained within them—must be removed in order to give products a shelf life.</p><p><strong>Health Benefits</strong></p><p>Although the nation is currently experiencing low-carb mania, fresh whole grain products are in fact good for you. They are low in fat, high in protein, and provide energy for your muscles and body.</p><p>High fiber found in whole grains helps in the management of obesity, diabetes, hemorrhoids, stroke, and heart attacks. Eating whole-grain foods on a regular basis has been shown to decrease risk for heart disease and high cholesterol levels, and is also thought to lower the risk of breast and colon cancer.</p><p>When milling your own flour, you’re able to mill only the amount you need, so nothing goes to waste and you are left with fresh-tasting flour.</p><p><strong>How do I bake bread without electricity?</strong></p><p>The best option may be an outdoor oven. These can be purchased commercially as well as do-it-yourself (DIY) options. If baking bread during an emergency is something you want to explore, start now and practice until you have it perfected.</p><h2><strong>Honey</strong></h2><p>Honey is more than just a sweetener. It is also an incredible survival food and medicine chest all in one.</p><p>Known throughout history for its health merits, honey is a broad spectrum healer. Heart disease, high cholesterol, influenza, wounds and infections respond well to this common golden liquid. Honey is one of the most outstanding survival foods that can stock a pantry. When stored in an airtight container and kept cool and dry, the shelf life of honey is remarkable — it does not turn rancid, ever. In fact, archeologists have found jars of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are still fit for human consumption. When selecting honey, it is important to focus on raw, organic and unfiltered varieties for the most bioactive properties. In addition, by using honey that comes from your own local area, this remarkable substance can help with allergies too. You should be aware that China has been sending counterfeit honey to the US market that is really corn syrup and other incorrect ingredients.</p><h2><strong>Can Opener!</strong></h2><p>The power is out and you don’t want that to get in the way of food preparation. That’s great, but you will need the tools, such as hand <strong>mixers</strong>, whisks, and don’t forget a <strong>manual</strong> <strong>can opener</strong>! While there are some battery powered options, the safest is to find devices that are powered by hand. Look around your kitchen and see what items you use regularly and are electric. What would you miss?</p><h2><strong>Final food for thought</strong></h2><p>You can survive 3 weeks without food.</p><p>Besides water, food is the most important item on your emergency preparation plan. Start now to gather the items you need. Look at expiration dates, nutritional value, calories, and preparation methods to help decide what is best for you and your family. Canned goods, dry pasta, bulk grains (rice) and beans, dehydrated foods, and freeze-dried foods are good items that can be stored a long time. Rotate your supplies as necessary so that nothing is wasted due to expiration. Get in the habit of not loading your freezer full of things that will melt and spoil. Pasteurized items in the refrigerator will still keep for a while once the power goes out depending on when you opened it. Try some food and drinks that you can enjoy at room temperature. Some drink mixes (including milk) are sold as a powder; just add water. It’s better to learn now which things are only acceptable hot or cold and start making choices about what to keep on hand. Purchasing food is just one piece of the puzzle. Foods that you can gather or raise outside your home can extend the duration of your supplies. What tools, implements, or weapons do you need? And, lastly, get ideas from like-minded people. You may have items (or skills) that someone else needs or vice-versa. We are collectively smarter than we are as individuals.</p><p>Bible rules for what you can eat.</p><p><a href=\\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11&amp;version=NLT\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11&amp;version=NLT</a></p><h1><strong>Sources</strong></h1><p><a href=\\"http://BePrepared.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BePrepared.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://Thrivelife.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Thrivelife.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://www.mountainhouse.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Mountain House</a></p><p><a href=\\"http://wisefoodstorage.com/?sm=fr&amp;gclid=CjgKEAjwwPabBRCXo46OtM_RhGMSJACgCeqAwIT_fY4qOEU9y2XspiHNvSyNWHF5icDefHxV6lGuZfD_BwE\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Wise Food Storage</a></p><p><a href=\\"https://shoreshdavidbrandon.org/end-times-preparedness-week-3/Wikepedia.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Wikepedia.org</a></p><p><a href=\\"https://shoreshdavidbrandon.org/end-times-preparedness-week-3/REI.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">REI.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"https://shoreshdavidbrandon.org/end-times-preparedness-week-3/EndTimesReport.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">EndTimesReport.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"https://shoreshdavidbrandon.org/end-times-preparedness-week-3/AmericanHunter.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">AmericanHunter.org</a></p><p><a href=\\"https://shoreshdavidbrandon.org/end-times-preparedness-week-3/breadbeckers.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">breadbeckers.com</a></p><p><a href=\\"https://shoreshdavidbrandon.org/end-times-preparedness-week-3/homesteadharvest.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">homesteadharvest.com</a></p><p><em>How to Survive Anything, Anywhere A Handbook of Survival Skills for Every Scenario and Environment – </em>Chris McNab</p><p><em>How to Survive the End of the World as we Know it</em> – James Wesley, Rawles</p><p><em>Wilderness Survival</em>, second edition – Gregory J.
